Cycling
--------------------------------------------------

2013-09-18

1. When I was about eleven I got a three-speed bike for my birthday. This was a time when a three-speed was the most a kid could hope for; ten-speeds were an impossible dream found only in American and British magazines. When I got the bike I carelessly left it outside without a lock for a few minutes. It was stolen. I couldn’t believe I no longer owned a bike. My family was not at all sympathetic. My older brothers rolled their eyes. I couldn’t decide whether to feel shame or anger.

2. Bicycling always meant freedom for me. Whenever I didn’t ride a bike this usually meant I had no freedom at that time in my life. When I first learned to ride I suddenly had the freedom to explore for miles around my city. I thought that owning a car would replace the feeling of freedom derived from riding a bike. But I found out that car ownership brought its own burdens: you could drive wherever cars could go, but it wasn’t uplifting in the same way as cycling was. With cycling there seems to be no downside (other than the chance of getting hurt in an accident).

3. Sometimes walking is more attractive than cycling. These tend to be good times too. But cycling is so much faster than walking. Walking is slow enough that you can examine every little bit of everything that passes by. Cycling is so much faster than this. So if you want to take photographs of blades of grass and unusual notice design details on buildings, walk around. However, if you have places to go but still want to interact with your surroundings in an intimate way, cycle.

4. Many places are not designed for cycling. If you cycle in those places people look at you like you are a lost soul, obviously too poor to do any better. Traffic terrifies many people; fear keeps people off of bikes in cites. Urban traffic can be uncomfortable on a bicycle, especially when you are at that boundary between inner-city traffic and full suburban traffic, where the car is king.

5. We were living in the Netherlands and not doing very well. We had a terrible time finding a place to live. It was the coldest place and seemed unlikely that we would ever make any friends there. When we saved enough to purchase some used bikes our worlds changed instantly. We became first class citizens. Our moods improved significantly after that. There is something deeply satisfying in cycling through an interesting European city, safely separated from traffic and other dangers, with hoards of co-cyclists keeping you company. It’s like you suddenly enter cycling heaven with the only ticket required being any kind of bike.

6. When you depend on cycling for your daily transportation then you need to fix things when they break. This usually means fixing flat tires. It can also be more serious, such as when someone hits your bike and your rear wheel needs to be replaced, or your gears fall apart. Then, drastic action may be required. My bicycle had broken, it wasn’t worth fixing so I needed a fast replacement. New ones were very expensive. I happened to pass a professional bike shop with a snazzy looking used mountain bike in the showroom. It wasn’t the most practical choice (mountain bikes in the Netherlands are not that common). But it was there, it was affordable and most importantly I desperately needed a bike to avoid a very painful train ride to work that Monday. I am still riding that same mountain bike ten years later.

7. Bike rides in the Netherlands can be very pleasant. They can also be horrible, windy affairs. Wind is the Dutch equivalent of getting caught in a Canadian snow storm in February. The wind can be brutal. Winds originating in the North Sea can make your journey hellish. At least snow is white and fluffy. Many times you wonder if it just wouldn’t be better to get off your bike, concede defeat and start walking. But you realize you will never get to where you're going.

Ottawa
--------------------------------------------------

2013-09-08

1. I was born in Ottawa. It is a quiet, bureaucratic city that nevertheless has many beauty spots. These often take place near its large river and historic canal. I remember a short hike I took once up from the locks beside Parliament Hill. The neo-Gothic Parliament Buildings are situated on a imposing bluff overlooking the Ottawa River. At one time you there was a trail around this bluff on which you could sit on a ledge halfway between the rapidly-flowing river and the top where the Parliament Buildings stand. It was perfectly beautiful that day, I was completely alone and enjoyed complete privacy. It took only five minutes to get there from the centre of downtown. The view over the river was breathtaking. I think few seats of government have such a naturally spectacular setting.

2. Ottawa had an extensive set of recreational bicycle paths built far earlier than most other cities (its commuter bike paths are much less well-developed). As kids we would often take long bike rides that went for miles along the river, down the Rideau Canal, through the fields of the Experimental Farm. A favourite jaunt was up the Gatineau Parkway where we could swim in Pink’s Lake, which was known for its deep clean water, caves and old mica mines. After an always-refreshing swim we would coast all the way back into Ottawa. I didn’t know it at the time but the quality of such bike rides would not be equaled in any other place I would later live.

3. Once when we were married we moved back to Ottawa from Berlin. We thought it would be a good place to live. Growing up there I had memories of its beauty, its easy access to nature, its reasonably attractive downtown core, its sun, and its climate that had both freezing winters suitable for skiing and skating, and hot hazy summers perfect for swimming and sunning. It is also a city that has much beautiful architecture, both historic and modern. I was shocked to have in Ottawa a perfectly awful time working there as an architect. I didn’t last long. There, we had the displeasure of attending perhaps the worst party given by my office colleagues at their home. The hosts were pretentious, inhospitable and lacked any sense of humour; perfectly ghastly party-throwers. Even while it going on we were both thinking: is this the worst time of our lives or is it just me? It turned out to be the polar opposite of a Pittsburgh party. This event, which unfortunately I came to associate with the social life of Ottawa in general, proved to me that you could go home but that it might make you want to run screaming from the place.

4. Ottawa is a bilingual city, which means there are French-speaking and English neighbourhoods. As in the rest of the province, most of the French speakers were bilingual and most of the anglos were monolingual. Where I grew up, mostly in the western Anglo suburb there was no French spoken at all. In my family and my experience French was an abstract notion perhaps possible to experience in far-off Montreal or Paris. This was before French immersion schools became popular and the privileged kids of the middle class would take many years of schooling entirely in French. When I was about 14 we moved from Ottawa to Halifax, NS. This put an end to my chances of speaking French as a normal part of life. Halifax, then as now, was even more anglo than the western suburbs of Ottawa.

5. The Rideau Canal was a focus of recreation when living in Ottawa. This canal was built in the early decades of the 19th C and remains as one the most picturesque canal systems in the world. In the summer it was the perfect place to stroll. In winter, a perfect place to skate. One a fine winter’s weekend day, the ice can be packed full of thousands of people enjoying a day of skating. It can be absolutely exhilarating. The delight at enjoying oneself in often frigid weather (the crowd gives off a lot of heat) and the social delight in gliding past thousands of smiling faces all on skates cannot be overestimated.

6. Ottawa could be such a pleasant place to wander around when I grew up. It had attractive downtown neighbourhoods. It had wonderful photography exhibits at the National gallery and the National Film Board Gallery. It residents seemed happy and privileged to live such an unthreatening place that seemed to have so much stability, prosperity and beauty. It was the perfect middle-class idyll. I think that’s what in the end did it for me. I wasn’t really looking for a stable middle-class life. I learned that such pleasantry can really get on your nerves. Not that urban beauty is not important, but I later learned that cultural stimulation is even more attractive.

7. We bought our first house in Ottawa. It was a tiny row house in an alley behind some other rowhouses in Chinatown. It was very cute but a bit of a slum—a very picturesque slum. It primary attractions were its walkability and its access to really good food. On the day we bought the house I walked home from work. The first welcoming smell was the Lebanese bakery, which had an elaborate storefront display of fresh pita coming straight from the oven. Then, a block later, the smells of two first-rate Chinese restaurants, the food at which we later learned was among the best in the country. Ottawa can be such a frigid, odourless place where ethnicity is often buried under a thick blanket of snow or suburban ennui. It is ironic that in this place I had the experience of coming home to our first house—a place where we could have lived for many years if things had worked out differently—and to be unexpectedly surrounded by odours one might associate with Beirut or Shanghai.

Pittsburgh
--------------------------------------------------



1. My first day at Carnegie Mellon we pulled up to the parking garage on Forbes Ave. in a rented Ford Taurus wagon. The person at the wicket asked me if I knew to which dorm my child had been assigned. The memory of that moment still makes me smile. 

2. There was a pizzeria around the corner from our apartment on Phillips Avenue in Squirrel Hill, which was famous far and wide. The secret of their fame what their pizzas were coated in a thick layer of cheese which bubbled like molten lava. I could never quite decide if this was the worst pizza I had ever eaten, or the best.

3. I was walking along Phillips Avenue and an orthodox Jewish man asked me if I could help him with something. He was very reluctant to tell what he wanted me to do. I explained that he at least had to tell me what he wanted me to do before I could help him, so I declined. I imagine that he wanted me to plug in a light, or something because he was prohibited from doing that on the Sabbath. I regret that I didn’t just help him out. I might have gotten a momentary glimpse into some alternative lifestyle.

4. We had just bought the twins home from the hospital and about ten minutes later our friends Alan and Jenn happened to walk by. We invited them up to see the new additions to our family. I think they were delighted to see the babies and maybe a little privileged to be the first ones to see them at their new home. This seemed like the perfect Pittsburgh moment. Joyous moments, which were completely spontaneous in nature, shared with dear friends. Things like that seemed to happen a lot in Pittsburgh.

5. Pittsburgh is a very hilly place where there are lots of obscure little communities under bridges, or along creeks, hidden from view. Once we took a walk in one of these places in the afternoon. I had to work all through the night to finish off some school assignment. It was a little hamlet, like what you might see along the Amalfi Coast in Italy, tucked away in your neighbourhood, just beneath the road. I like this idea that right under the highway that you might travel on frequently there might be a hidden community that few visit, or are aware that exists, yet may have been there for hundreds of years.

6. The first social event we attended at Carnegie Mellon was the so-called International Food Fest. Since almost all the graduate students came from outside the US, everyone had a dish they could prepare from their home countries. We brought Vietnamese spring rolls. I explained that nothing says Canada more to us than Vietnamese food. I don’t think anyone believed me, but it is true.

7. I had this offer of a post-doc job at the Technical University of Delft in the Netherlands. At the time this seemed like a great opportunity (which is actually was). However, my wife was not at all eager to accompany me on this journey. She was very reluctant to travel away from her family, or from her beloved Pittsburgh. Finally, she did agree to move to the Netherlands, but it was at this point our marriage began its collapse. Once you have experienced the warmth of Pittsburgh, every place else—even you own home town—seems like a bit of a let-down.


New York City
--------------------------------------------------

1. I landed at the Port Authority Bus Terminal in New York City sometime in the early 70’s. This bus terminal had, and still has, the reputation as being a den of iniquity, where people are ushered from a state of rural or suburban innocence into the metropolitan depravity of the City. Actually, the terminal was not that scary and today seems no worse than most other big city bus terminals. It just happens to be a place through which poor people travel. In the political and moral climate of the USA this is reason enough to make it seem much worse than it is.

2. 42 St is just around the corner from the Port Authority Bus Terminal in NYC. When I first visited NYC, the strip just west of Times Square was the centre of the porn cinema, sex and tattoo shop trade. It had a 70’s luridness and full-on exploitative sleaze that is hard to duplicate today [I’m not sure that the current, family-friendly, much sanitized version is an improvement]. It was exactly the part of town that famed photographer Diane Arbus liked to frequent in her search for colourful and photogenic characters. In fact, this is exactly what I thought as I walked around that day: this place looks exactly like the photographs of Diane Arbus.

3. We heard that our friend’s mother had just died in NYC. We decided right at that moment to attend her funeral. We packed up our trusty Tercel crossed the ample width of Pennsylvania and drove over the George Washington Bridge. We soon found ourselves in a compact Bronx apartment where our friend’s family was sitting Shiva. Our friend was very glad to see us. The family was very welcoming and kind and they fed us well. It was a good idea to go to that funeral. It was one of the best spontaneous decisions we have ever made.

4. New York City is one of the best walking towns in the world. It is easy to misjudge the scale of the island of Manhattan. It looks so manageable on the map but is so unbelievably vast in reality. It happens every visit: being a rube you want to walk everywhere because everything is so interesting. You end walking more than you have ever walked in your entire life. Your feet are so unsuited to cover a vast territory you end up exploring only a tiny part of town with each visit: the West Village one time, the Lower East Side another. Getting around more effectively by hopping in a cab or a subway seems like cheating. The city demands that you walk your feet off and that you come back home exhausted and happy.

5. There is gallary outpost of the Museum of Modern Art in Queens called PS1, which is installed in a old public school building, hence the name. It specializes in installation work and is just a short subway ride across the East River. If you like installation art, it is well worth a visit. One installation we saw there had wires string between the walls. A huge bird cage had been constructed with birds flying around inside, with vegetation and a sound component where each time the birds landed on a wire a twangy and ethereal sound was created. Multiply that by many birds, you get an ambient cacophony. It took me a few seconds to understand what was going on, but once I had my ‘aha’ moment, I realized that this was almost certainly the most impressive installation piece I had ever seen.

6. Not long ago I attended a conference at the Centre for Social Innovation-NYC. There, I presented a paper, talked with many, helped out as the ‘tech’ guy, staff photographer, organizational helper and greeter. Despite the value of all of those roles my proudest moment was when I became the impromptu DJ. One evening of the conference there was a party. Most conferences have such social events; usually they’re not much fun. This one was different. The crowd, food and space were all perfect: exactly what you would hope for in a good NYC loft party. Except there was no music. Sensing a golden opportunity to entertain, I took it upon myself to plug—into the centre’s portable PA system—my computer’s iTunes library, which contains an inspired selection of Brazilian and American soul music. Like soundtracks in films, music at parties doesn’t have to be overpowering, or even noticeable, it just has to be present.

7. I had just come back on my bike ride from my job in Delft to our apartment in Rotterdam. I had just got in the door when our Indonesian neighbour told us to come downstairs quickly and watch what was going on in NYC. The Twin Towers had been attacked and one had already fallen. It took several minutes to understand what was going on as we nervously watched the neighbour’s TV. How many people must have died? 10,000? 50,000? Obviously things had changed, but we didn’t know quite how. After about an hour we went back upstairs a bit stunned. One thing that did strike me that day, in addition to the obvious geopolitical and humanitarian disaster that 9/11 entailed, was that the Twin Towers would no longer be around. I had nostalgia for the buildings themselves. You really knew that you were in NYC when you saw them. The Empire State Building is impressive but it is not quite the same.

Food
--------------------------------------------------

1. I lived in a co-op house and was fresh from leaving home. Once a week we had to cook dinner for everyone. In the days before webpages and smartphones I wanted to a do a good job but had few recipes or ideas about what to cook. So a couple of hours before the meal I would visit the central library and browse through cooking books. One day I came across a recipe for sole with a curry yogurt sauce. I bought the ingredients and went home and cooked the dish. It turned out to be a culinary triumph. At the time I just assumed that this was what being an adult was like.

2. I drove to Buffalo one day and bought a Fagor pressure cooker set from Macy’s. At the time I thought this was a slightly outlandish thing to do. However, as it turned out it was one of my most sensible purchases. I found I could cook beans and legumes very quickly with it and that by eating those things I could lose weight and appreciate foods lower on the food chain. Later, I found that I could live on practically nothing: a bag of brown rice and a piece of ginger, all because of my handy Spanish pressure cooker.

3. My mother was always interested in nutritious eating. She was a nurse by training and took nutrition seriously. She used to make quite good meals: fresh vegetables, salads, nuts and meat. Later, when she started to lose her faculties and approach senility she resorted more to frozen bags of vegetables and prepared meat dishes. The change was gradual so we didn't really notice it. Mostly, though it was because we lived far away and only saw her once or twice a year. Near the end the decline was precipitous. We learned that when the food changes for the worse, in a dramatic way, that something serious is going on.

4. I was unemployed but I enjoyed cooking. I would take great pleasure in making meals for the family. Surprisingly, I didn’t get that much encouragement. My wife always complimented me on my efforts but I could see that she thought that this wasn’t how the family should be working. She had inherited an idea from her mother that cooking in the home should be the responsibility of the woman. To me this always seemed like a silly idea.

5. I always hated following recipes. I always preferred taking a bag of random food ingredients and making something tasty out of them. I have met people who have made fun of this and have taken pity on my lack of interest in recipes. I realized that much can be learned from cookbooks but I always wanted to take food from first principles, unburdened by cultural habits. People only sample a tiny fraction of the foods available to them. They get into culinary ruts early in life. People may think you are strange if you attempt to get out of these ruts and go freestyle.

6. With a lot of food you are signalling wealth and prosperity but having too much of it is almost always detrimental to your health. People of rich countries need to feel hunger once in awhile. They will learn that hunger is not so bad, especially if you know that food is available. Hunger with food is quite different from hunger without food. Also, not eating is an excellent way of losing weight.

7. People eat themselves into the grave so often. We know we should eat something else, but we just can’t do it. We would rather suffer debilitating illnesses than change our self-invented diet. Food is a very powerful idea around which we seem to construct our whole identity.


East Germany
--------------------------------------------------

1. We used to walk around our neighbourhood in the former East Berlin. It was just north of the small suburb of Pankow. We were at the edge of the city. People kept small allotment gardens, or Kleingartens, that were very well-kept and usually had little houses where people would spend their evenings and weekends. The more ambitious lived in their sometimes-elaborate little houses year-round. These Kleingartens were almost always immaculate and often charming. It was the East German equivalent of a suburban backyard lifestyle. People went there to get away from the prying eyes of the state, or of their neighbours. But since these little gardens were so densely packed together there was not much escape.

2. The road ended in the former West Berlin at the Wall. Not soon after the cobble stones began. These were much bumpier to ride our bikes on than the smooth pavement in the West. The East was just opening up. The Ossis, or Easterners, were just getting their bearings. For some their world has just collapsed, for others their lives had just begun. We were told that some aspects about the former East were almost comically bad: the constant surveillance, the pettiness, the parochialism; but there were good things too: the intimacy, the modesty, the emphasis on small-scale pleasures spent with friends and family. A sometimes-charming, often-backwards little country vanished very quickly in those days.

3. We went into an art supply store in Pankow that was having a closeout sale. Like many enterprises in the East its viability could not survive the earthquake of unification. There were some good quality supplies in the shop: watercolour paints, papers, paint brushes and easels. The assistant showed us into a large storage room in the back. It was very large. It would have made an excellent studio for a sculptor. On one wall she showed us a huge stack of clear glass tubes. Each was about 6 feet long and about 2 inches in diameter. There were hundreds of them. She asked if we might be interested in buying some. We had no idea what they were originally used for or what possible use we could put them to if we did. We politely declined.

4. For a couple of months in the East the closest store to us was this little corner store in the old style. It was small, had few things to buy and was right across the street from a large cemetery where we liked to wander and examine old mossy WWI gravesites. The things we bought from this store tended to be bread (often of a hard and dark variety), coffee, cheese, jam from the Balkans, butter, and cans and cans of lentil soup. We really like the taste of the lentil soup, even though often there were little stones mixed in with it. Our diet consisted solely of those things for several weeks before we discovered more elaborate shops and weekly markets nearby. It’s like we were transported into pre-WWII Germany. The East Block I guess was like this: there was not that much to buy; you had to occupy your time with something other than buying stuff.

5. Herr Meyer employed me as an architect for a few months. It was a very interesting experience (until we decided to move back to Canada). He had set up a basement room in which he was establishing his private architectural practice. The tax authorities would often visit and gives him tips about how to set up his business. He wife was very stern- looking but very nice. Their daughter was on the track team at school and had enormous thigh muscles. Her mother complained that she wanted to quit the track team and spend more time with her boyfriend, which her mother thought was a bad idea. About once a week they would invite me up to their homey, wood-lined kitchen and feed me lunch. It was often deep-fried something, such as pork rinds, and soup. It was a fun time. My German improved during that time.

6. The first time I went into East Berlin was a real opener. I didn’t know much about it. I was familiar with West Berlin by that time. I had assumed, in my ignorance, that the Kudamm and Charlottenburg were in the heart of Berlin. I crossed over at Checkpoint Charlie. I wandered across a new, alien landscape in which huge opera houses, museums, cathedrals, and empty-looking office blocks stood. The main downtown of the former unified Berlin was obviously in this part of town (which is called Mitte). It would be similar if you passed through a door in downtown Toronto and found yourself in a much older part of the city, where the centre used to be but no one had told you about.

7. You might expect the former Easterners (Ossis) to be humourless and mean, like in an old spy movie, and the Westerners (Wessis) to be open, happy and glad to be living in a wealthy country where the cars were fast and shiny. But we didn’t find that. The Ossis tended to be quiet, reserved, often very nice. The Wessis tended to be louder, richer, and a bit arrogant in their assumptions. We were friends with a West Berlin artist. She was beautiful, smart, talented and extremely well-educated. One day we were discussing the plight of the Ossis and how some were being kicked out of their homes and factories. We expected her to take pity on the poor Ossis because we assumed that is what liberal artists tend to do. We were perplexed and a bit horrified when she said that the Ossis just had to adapt to the new circumstances; their old world was gone forever and that crying about it wouldn’t make it come back.


East Pennant
--------------------------------------------------

1. City Mouse and Country Mouse East Pennant is a little hamlet deep in the fog belt, about 30km south of Halifax, Nova Scotia. I spent my high school years there. Before we moved there we lived in one of the most urban parts of Halifax, which I quite enjoyed. When my father announced that we were moving to East Pennant I was shocked and dismayed. I was setting myself up to live as a city kid. My father was the opposite. He had grown up as a city kid in downtown Toronto and had voted with his feet to be as far away from that as he could be.

2. Hike Around Pennant Point One of the premiere attractions of living in East Pennant was the hike around the point. This took about 5 hours. It usually started at Crystal Crescent Beach, then as now, a wide white sand beach. There was a trail that went by huge rocks, beautiful mossy forests and beaches of all types. Near the end of Pennant Point there were no trees, just bogs, rock and pounding surf. Once you had passed the end of the point the forest began again. There was another trail that led right to my parent’s house. It was a fairly long hike and it always felt good to get back home. I would often take friends on this hike. It is one of the best ones in Nova Scotia.

3. Four Wheel Drifts in the Snow I took a school bus to high school. It would often snow heavily during the winter. A foot of snow was not at all uncommon. Our bus driver was a local fisherman who made a bit of money in the winter driving kids to school. He drove very fast on the snow packed roads. He really like to do ‘four-wheel drifts’ in which all four wheels drifted into the corner, as often as he could. The kids on board appreciated the skill required to perform these moves.

4. Americans Brought Refinement Many Americans came to live Nova Scotia during the time of the Vietnam War. Often these so-called draft-dodgers were much better educated than your typical Nova Scotian. The neighbours to my parents after I had left home were American expats. One was my English teacher from Grade 11. Her husband was an orchestral percussionist. They had (and still have) a beautiful house on a hill, with a greenhouse and a little barn. They always had much better taste than my parents and their house was perfectly designed, ready for a magazine photo shoot, whereas my parents’ was much more ramshackle.

5. Those Sons of Fishermen are Strong Some of the kids on my schoolbus were the children of fisherman. While I was I my bedroom reading books or drawing they were helping their fathers on their boats. This must have been heavy and dangerous work at times. These boys were incredibly strong and muscular, whereas I was thin and scrawny. Yet they didn’t use to their physical prowess to dominate or bully others. I remember them as good kids, who were good students too. But their accents were different from mine. Just think of the strongest Canadian accent you have ever heard and multiply that my two. I wish I had brought a tape recorder.

6. Mossy Zen Garden Near our house was a mossy forest. The floor of the forest was a perfect moss carpet. There was lots of water and fog and the moss seemed to love the climate. I always thought that this moss was the greatest thing and could potentially be made into an elaborate Zen garden. My parents didn’t seem to share this enthusiasm for moss. They much prefered standard lawns, which usually looked like they didn't quite suit the climate and geography.

7. There is no such thing as Bad Weather Nova Scotia has a harsh climate. If the weather is fine, which occasionally it is, people notice it because the rest of the time it isn’t. It was often cold, windy and wet. If you are not well-dressed this can be miserable. But if you are well-dressed then the fog and the damp can provide a very cosy feeling. The things I remember about the place are the type of people you meet there, the smell of the air, and how cosy it felt to be out of the rain.

Family life
--------------------------------------------------

1. When I was a boy my father designed and built a small geodesic dome in the garage. After he had finished building all the pieces he rented a truck to take them to the lake. While the truck moved my brothers and I had to hold onto the large wooden triangles in the back of the truck to keep them them from falling out onto the highway. It was terrifying.

2. During the night it had snowed heavily. There was much was much snow on the road as my father and I drove into town. When I got to my highschool I expected that some mention would be made of the heavy snowfall the previous night and how a foot of snow on the ground made driving and walking difficult. But there was no mention of it. The unspoken understanding seemed to be that such things happen during a Nova Scotia winter and we need not mention them.

3. As a child we used to move between Ottawa, Ontario and Halifax, Nova Scotia frequently. Although both places were largely white, anglo places, there were large cultural and economic difference between them. Ottawa was far richer, busier and more consumer-oriented. Halifax was more traditional and gentler yet had a harsher climate.

4. My first romantic attachment was with an Iranian student studying engineering in Canada. She was an interesting and attractive woman but had bad memories of repression back in Iran, both from the Shah’s regime and from her brothers. She seemed like a wounded soul and I suspected she drowned her sorrows with alcohol.

5. One day in Rotterdam I decided to teach the twins how to ride bicycles. We had an ideal place in front of our Rotterdam apartment: a sidewalk several meters wide with little traffic. They each took turns on the two-wheeler. It took a couple hours of practice. Just at the end when they were getting the hang of it their mother came home and they were able to demonstrate their new cycling skills to her. Everyone was beaming with pride.

6. I once took the boys to Utrecht’s Railway Museum [Verkeersmuseum] where they were having an open house. The boys had a great time driving the railway simulators and getting in and out of rail carriages. There was a face painting stand so they both got their faces painted as little tigers [tijgertje]. On the train ride home the Dutch found it amusing to see a pair of tired, cranky twins disguised as little tigers.

7. When I was about ten my parents hosted a house party for my father’s Navy pals. In the kitchen my siblings and I made a list on the chalkboard of what everyone was drinking. We made sure that whenever anyone finished their drink they were offered another one instantly. The adults got drunk very quickly and we were widely praised for our attentiveness and efficiency.

8. One of my brothers once had a big argument with my mother. He got very upset with her and told her to go the hell. This, we thought was unbelievably brazen. Then, in his fury, he [accidentally] charged through a glass patio door. We later visited him in hospital. Luckily, he wasn’t seriously injured.

9. Once we had a car that had large holes in the floor boards due to rust. We could see the road going by as we drove. At a stoplight our puppy named Polly ran through one of these holes and escaped onto the street. It took us several hours to find her.

10. My mother liked to smoke in our car. As a child I often became nauseous from cigarette smoke, especially on long car journeys. At the time we thought this was the just the cost of being a kid.

11. One day my father and a school friend of mine visited a ocean-front lot near Halifax, Nova Scotia on which my father hoped to build his dream home. It was very foggy that day and we couldn’t see anything. My father later bought the lot and did built his dream home there. My parents lived in it for thirty years. My friend who came with us that day ended up buying that house once my parents died.

12. My parents and I took my older sister to university for the first time. We dropped her off at a co-op house on Lowther Avenue in Toronto. I could see that it was emotional time for my parents. My sister seemed happy to be free in the big city. I didn’t see much of my sister until my father died forty years later.

13. Once I visited a lake on which our family had a cottage for the first time in twenty five years. I heard the voice of a neighbour’s daughter who was swimming in the lake. She was now fully grown. I remembered her voice and I could clearly recall this woman when she was a girl laughing the same way as she swam.

14. When we were kids, on weekends, we liked to ride our bikes for miles and explore our sprawling suburban world. My brothers would buy a pizza and we would eat it greedily in the back of a high school, several miles from our house.

15. My first glimpse of the Holocaust was during my first trip to Europe. My friend and I visited a small concentration camp in the Vosges mountain near Strasbourg [I believe it was Natzweiler-Struthof]. The area seemed like such a beautiful part of France. The reality of the gas ovens didn’t seem to fit in with the beauty of the countryside.

16. When we left Berlin we looked out the window of the airplane as it circled Tegel and we could clearly see the buildings on Erbeskopfweg where we had been living for six months (in the Niederschoenhausen section of the former East Berlin). It was odd seeing them so clearly from the air. It was like they were trying to tell us something.

17. Once, my father in a drunken state convinced me to write my grade six social studies paper in a satirical style. ‘Anyone can write it straight’ he explained. It was hard thing to do but I got into it and completed it in that style. The teacher downgraded greatly me for my efforts. He clearly thought that essays in grade six should be serious and done straight.

18. The nurses said that once the rattle came the end was near. My mother’s breathing was rattling. My wife and I went for a walk at lunch along the beach. When we returned to the home my mother had died. The nurses explained that people often die when their loved- ones are out of the room. They view it as their last act of kindness.

19. When we had the twins we were terrified at first. Even though we were good parents, we often got angry at them because we were stressed, they were so much work and we didn’t know what we were doing. When we got angry we always felt ashamed. After many years we learned not to get angry at the boys. We learned that anger was not the correct response and that the shame afterwards was just too painful.

20. My father wanted to clean off the mooring cable which had been clogged with seaweed. He wanted me to dive down with a knife and clean it off. I entered the ocean but the water was so cold that I immediately abandoned the task. Even with a wetsuit on it would have been very difficult. I felt like a pearl diver who had flunked his first test.

21. My parents and I were visiting my grandmother in Pittsburgh. My father didn’t like driving through the sinuous valleys and along the dark forested creeks of suburban Pittsburgh. He found it hard to keep his bearings. My father peevishly asked my grandmother how anyone could live in such a place. My grandmother explained sweetly that if you grow up there it’s not a problem. She perhaps should have told him to fuck off.

22. When you have twins it is good idea to spend time with just one of them on occasion. Once, I had a wonderful walk with son Ben through downtown Hamilton. We talked, as we often do, about lots of things. When we returned home we learned that my father had just died in Nova Scotia.

23. My father used to discuss the latest research findings on cholesterol and blood pressure with his equally overweight friends. They were trying to decide whether a lifetime of avoiding exercise might be bad for their health. But in the end they were devoted to their habits, come what may.

24. When my parent got older one visit we sat them down and asked them whether it might be wise to move into town so they would be closer to a hospital. My father got very uncomfortable with this line of questioning and stated that he intended to die in the house he had built. He got his wish.

25. Our first cat we named Helen. She learned quickly how to be adorable. She was our ‘test case’ before having children. Once the twins arrived she proved to be a clever cat and realized quickly that our priorities had shifted towards the babies and away from her.

26. I did an all-nighter at architecture school. I was deep in sleep the next day at home when my girlfriend woke me and told me to get up, we were driving with friends to someone’s cottage on the Northumberland Strait. That weekend was like a Nova Scotia version of La Dolce Vita.

27. When I lived in London I started going to a place called Wigmore Hall, which is a recital hall in the west end. They had cheap classical concerts there. Just when I decided that going to such concerts was something I really liked to do I was forced to leave London. The idea that going to cheap classical concerts is something I enjoy doing was put on the back burner for several decades.

28. When I first went to Europe when I was a teenager I had on my list two places that I really had to see: one was Gaudi’s Sagrada Familia in Barcelona and the other was the Alhambra in Granada. I managed to see both those buildings on that trip. The first was a bit odd but the Alhambra was the most beautiful thing I have ever seen.

29. I met her at a friend’s wedding reception in Kensington Market in Toronto. I remember that she made a joke about the bride and groom making a terrible mistake. She was German, which I really liked. She had beautiful green eyes. We were together for 25 years.

30. We had just flown from Rotterdam and were visiting relatives in Brighton. I was feeling sorry for myself because I wasn’t enjoying living in Holland. I took a walk down a pedestrian precinct in Brighton early one morning where noisy, drunken kids were recovering from late night revelry. I don’t know what it was but I had a feeling of being in a familiar place all of a sudden. It wasn’t just the language, it was also the squalour.

31. My twin sons put their arms around my shoulder like they are comforting their own son. They are a still a few inches shorter than me so this gesture is intentionally comical, but in a few short years I expect they will tower over me, which will make it much easier. I think they have realized early that an important job for them is to comfort their parents in their declining years.

32. I had a room in a pensione in Malaga for about a week. I wandered around the old town contentedly. I thought the local Alcazaba was amazing. I was surprised that I could buy a Cuba Libre in the local bar for next to nothing. I was only 17. The landlady at the pensione suggested I take a shower in their apartment since they had hot water. If I was bit more worldly and less shy at the time I would have gladly accepted her offer. She seemed very kind, like many of the Spanish, and she had a beautiful daughter.
