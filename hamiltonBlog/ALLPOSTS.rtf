\cf0 Hamilton's Art Crawl occurs on the second Friday of every month. My wife and I try to go to it every month. What attracts us is not the only the art, which can sometimes be quite interesting, but also the street life and crowd scenes that the crawl attracts. These types of crowds we find very enjoyable. There is a variety of people who form these crowds: young hipsters, middle-aged people with interest in art or culture, people who happen to be walking by and those who simply wish to enjoy the streets of Hamilton. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl233\sa230
\cf0 The Art Crawl is located on James St North--the heart of the historic core of Hamilton. On its route are the Hamilton Armory and the Anglican Christ's Church Cathedral--two of the more attractive architectural landmarks in downtown Hamilton. Along the route there is some retail, several galleries, a few restaurants. The Mixed Media store at the corner of James and Cannon is a major crowd attractor. In the galleries not much art appears to get sold. On the surface not much money appears to be changing hands. At times other than during these once-monthly events, the neighbourhood goes back to its normal role as a downtown street with shops, sports bars and restaurants that serves a lively, mostly Portuguese community. \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233\sa230
\cf0 Art crawls provide not only a means to revitalize a city but also provide glimpses of alternative lifestyles. One group found at the Art Crawl are young people trying to establish identities as artists or designers, or to flirt with the possibility of creative, possibly unconventional lifestyles. In larger cities, with well-established cultural industries, the sight of such young people are commonplace. In Hamilton, they are a new development. \
Such young members of the 'creative classes' I think are important for the future of Hamilton. In the current Canadian economic climate, which does not favour Hamilton's economic base of heavy industry and manufacturing, an Art Crawl appears to be a low cost way to experiment with possible futures. It will not provide all the answers, but it does provide new ideas for a city dependent on declining smoke-stack industries. \
If I were someone who wishes to invest money in the Art Crawl (as opposed to merely attend them) I would think about some of the following issues: <h2>The Art Crawl only happens once a month. Is that enough to make a real impact on the city?</h2> In my mind the Art Crawl is a big development in the cultural life of Hamilton. By their nature Art Crawls can't be continuous events, since then there wouldn't be time for artists to produce art or put together new shows. Art Crawls depend on the production of new art to remain interesting and authentic. In a city like Hamilton there is only a limited supply of such work. <h2>Where could the Art Crawl lead for Hamilton?</h2> The Art Crawl will likely have the effect of bringing development to James St North. If this development process is successful, practising artists who are dependent on cheap rents may eventually be driven out. In Hamilton's case though, James St North is adjacent to regions of Hamilton such as the Beasley and Barton Street that should have cheap rents for the foreseeable future; a stone's throw from James St North are some of the most poverty-afflicted urban areas in Canada. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl231
\cf0 What Hamilton needs are not just areas that might support development or gentrification (which is not necessarily a good thing) but in the creation of cultural industries where people might be able to find stable employment. In this respect I think the Art Crawl is very promising. <h2>Should Art Crawls be about art or can they be generalized to other things?</h2> Art Crawls depend on the existence of artists studios, galleries and other aspects of cultural production to become viable. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl231\sa230
\cf0 Doors Open events on the other hand depend on the existence of a body of architectural and urban design resources that can be visited. They could be called 'Architectural Crawls.' \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233
\cf0 Other possible types of crawls might be: \
\pard\pardeftab720\li710\fi-710\sl233
\cf0 <ul> <li>Crawls within and between neighbourhoods (e.g. Jane's Walks)</li> <li>Crawls between bars and restaurants (Pub Crawls)</li> <li>Crawls that show the inside of factories or other workplaces (Factory Crawls)</li> <li>Crawls between houses of worship (God Crawls)</li> \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233\sa230
\cf0 </ul> What is common to all of these is that they involve people willing to engage in their city and to interact in a way that may not have been possible without them. <h2>Art Crawls are cool and fun, but do they actually earn anyone any money?</h2> Art Crawls are initially intended to support artists and galleries. It is usually the arts communities that initially promote them. If they become popular and start attracting crowds then these crowds can be put to many uses. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl233\sa230
\cf0 One of the most common side-effects is that they can increase property values in artists districts, which often has the effect of eventually displacing artists from these districts. I think the potential to create new markets for cultural goods is real yet the probability that artists will necessarily benefit from this process is uncertain. \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233\sa230
\cf0 Art Crawls are like websites that provide a service of real value yet are free to users. The initial goal is to attract an audience. Often the revenue stream that might be derived from this audience is not always clear at the beginning. <h2>Are Art Crawls elitist events; do they alienate as well as attract segments of the population?</h2> To become excited about an Art Crawl one presumably needs to have some interest in artists, galleries and cultural expression. This will likely remain a minority interest in an industrial city like Hamilton. Yet, being a minority interest is not necessarily elitist. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl231
\cf0 There appears to be no attempt by most participants to gain extra privilege by attending these events. Most participants just seem to want to enjoy art. People who enjoy art are not necessarily members of an elite group despite fine art's occasional connection to those with power and influence. In fact, artists are often among the lowest paid members of society.]]></content:encoded> \

\cf0 I am lucky to live in a border region of Canada. Over the weekend I visited some old friends in Buffalo, NY. Driving to Buffalo takes about an hour from my home in Hamilton. Passports are now required for travel into the States. This prevents those without passports from making the crossing. This tends to discriminate more against Americans than it does Canadians, since the proportion of Americans without passports is higher. Going into the USA from Canada is a more unsettling experience than the reverse journey (regardless of your nationality). The heightened American border paranoia discourages casual tourism between the countries and overall this policy of treating all visitors with heightened suspicion appears contrary to American interests. But they do let me in. <h2>Quality of architecture</h2> Buffalo has a reputation as being an iconic rust-belt city whose fortunes have fallen on hard times. It tends to reinforce the Canadian attitude towards the States as a place where social and political problems somehow seem more intractable. However, from an architectural perspective it might surprise some that Buffalo contains many architectural jewels. The eras before and after the Gilded Age have been kind to Buffalo, at least for buildings you might find in architectural guide books. Outstanding architects such as Wright, Richardson, Sullivan, Upjohn and Olmsted left their mark in way that cannot be matched on the Ontario side of the border, even in the larger cities such as Toronto. Whatever appeal Canada might have does not appear to be caused by the quality of its architecture or urban planning. <h2>End of Steel</h2> Despite its wealth of architecture, Buffalo appears to suffer from the processes of post-industrialization much more severely than does Ontario. In Buffalo and nearby Lackawanna (the Buffalo equivalent of the East End of Hamilton), the mills pulled out quickly, leaving behind a wealth of industrial ruins, which are photogenic in that post-apocalyptic style I so admire. As in its sister city of Pittsburgh, the steel producers decided very quickly that there was no point in pretending that steel production had a future there. In Ontario, they apparently didn't make such a decision and the steel factories continue to belch smoke and to provide employment. The industrial districts of Hamilton continue to appear much like Lackawanna did thirty years ago. It is not at all clear why the two nations have had this different trajectory despite being located in what seems to be similar geographical and market contexts. <h2>Geography</h2> Buffalo, even though it is the second largest city in New York state, is an outpost for the state on Lake Erie. It is separated from the main population centres in eastern New York state by the Appalachian mountain range. Buffalo faces the sometimes obscure northern country of Canada and depends on the Great Lakes for its water-bound transportation. A major factor in Buffalo's history was the construction of the Erie Canal system, which connects the inland waterways of the Great Lakes to the Hudson River. When the canal first opened in 1825 it provided a direct link to the fast-growing regions of the West. This geographical advantage, which encouraged the early growth of Buffalo, has now disappeared. Canada is a country for which proximity to the USA is a fundamental factor in development. The USA has a huge internal market. This means it's not too dependent on exposure to its northern neighbour. <h2>Population and population decline</h2> Ontario is the centre of population density in Canada. Hamilton is near the geographic centre of the so-called 'Golden Horseshoe' area of Ontario, situated at the western end of Lake Ontario. It is part of one of the few regions in Canada that approaches the population density of the eastern seaboard of the USA. Hamilton not only functions as an industrial centre [in probable decline], but also as a city which is in commutable distance to several dynamic, growing cities in the region, such as Toronto and Waterloo. Hamilton is geographically at the centre of its own national context whereas Buffalo is off to one side. Buffalo, like Pittsburgh and other rust belt cities has suffered de-population due to the processes of de-industrialization. This appears to be a major factor in the overall morale of the city. It is harder to feel good about your city if your friends and neighbours are continually 'voting with their feet.' Hamilton has not experienced such de-population and its morale seems correspondingly higher. <h2>Race Relations</h2> Hamilton has a predominantly white population and has, until fairly recently, been populated predominantly by those of European descent. This is now changing after the introduction of more equitable, colour-blind immigration policies in Canada in the 60's and 70's. Hamilton now sees the growth of new communities by immigrants from Asia, Africa and the Middle East. If immigration trends continue Hamilton will follow the lead of Toronto and increasingly have a foreign-born population whose ancestral ties are not with Europe. This demographic change is welcomed from most quarters and adds to the attractiveness of the city for both investment and daily living. \
In Buffalo, there is a similar population of Europeans who were attracted during the last century to jobs in industry, as can be found in Hamilton. An important aspect of American social history is the Great Migration of blacks from the southern states to work in northern industrial cities such as Buffalo. This internal migration, which has had such a dramatic effect on racial politics in the USA, has no equivalent in Canada. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl231
\cf0 In Hamilton, as in Buffalo, there are blighted neighbourhoods where property values are low, environmental degradation is severe and overall morale and opportunities are limited. What appears to be different is that in Hamilton the racial composition of these neighbourhoods does not appear to be a factor in their blight. In Buffalo, and in other American cities such as Pittsburgh, Cleveland and Detroit, the racial composition of neighbourhoods plays an important role in urban geography.]]></content:encoded> \

Beck, Maine" width="150" height="113" />[/caption] \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233\sa230
\cf0 This week I had the unpleasant task of telling Art Barker, a local roofer who specializes in standing-seam roofs, that I would not be using him to replace our roof. The reason that it was unpleasant was not only the disappointment that Art would feel for not getting the contract but also because I <em>really</em> wanted a standing-seam roof for our home [specifically, a mill finish Galvalume Plus standing-seam roof]. I had searched far and wide for the best roof available and I had found it. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl233\sa230
\cf0 Art certainly seemed like a talented, responsible roofer who had a real love of fine roofs. Art sold me on the benefits of standing seam roofing, but I was not too hard to convince. I was already convinced before I had even talked to Art. He had just confirmed my suspicions that standing-seam was perhaps the most attractive roofing technology available for pitched roofs. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl231\sa230
\cf0 Standings-seam roofs are common in commercial and institutional buildings but are rare for houses in this country. The reason I couldn't get a standing-seam roof for myself is that I couldn't afford one; they are more expensive than other roofs. Standing-seam roofs are the top of the line. The Cadillac solution. There are other metal roofs available that attempt to duplicate the quality of a standing-seam roof without having to mechanically bend metal during installation to form the standing seam. These, however, do not seem nearly as elegant as a well-installed standing-seam roof by someone like Art. \
Metals such as lead, copper and galvanized steel have been used on roofs for a long time. St Paul's Cathedral in London has a beautiful lead roof that withstood the Blitz. At Dundurn Castle, near our home in Hamilton, some of the roofs there have beautiful copper and lead detailing. Slate tiles are also a traditional choice for high quality historical roofs in the area. Slate though costs a fortune and requires a much stronger roof structure. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl233\sa230
\cf0 Galvalume, which is an aluminum-zinc alloy coating over a steel core, seems like it would last forever. Standing seam creates a mechanically-fixed layer of solid metal over your whole roof. Art would supply hidden fixings for the metal panels. Installing a standing-seam roof is like sewing a fine suit. Its quality depends not only on the quality of the material but on how well the material is bent and stitched together. I was convinced, and remained convinced, that a standing-seam roof would indeed last forever. \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233\sa230
\cf0 Why do I prefer standing-seam roofs? Two main reasons: Longevity and other green factors, and Appearance. <h2>Longevity and other Green Factors</h2> Your typical asphalt or fiberglass roof lasts possibly 20-25 years. Even though 40 or 50 year shingles are advertised I don't buy it. A standing-seam metal would last at least twice that of an asphalt roof. I think a roof by Art would last 75 years, long after the house we live in has new owners. Standing-seam roofs have inherent mechanical advantages over shingle roofs. That means they should survive high winds, bright sun and freezing rain much better than a few layers of gunk-infused fiberglass with a light gravel coating. Things that last a long time have an inherent quality about them. The 18 year old Toyota Tercel that is parked on our street has such a quality. It's almost like you become a more responsible citizen by purchasing such a product. \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233
\cf0 A standing-seam roof is built of recyclable material, none of which should end in a landfill after it is replaced. Metal appears to be much more chemically inert compared to asphalt and does not leach toxic chemicals. The higher reflectance of a metal roof reduces cooling loads in the summer. \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233\sa230
\cf0 When an asphalt roof fails and must be replaced all of its material goes straight into landfill. It is not-recyclable. They probably leak toxic waste once in the landfill. The rain that falls on them before that must also leach toxic chemicals, which mixes with groundwater. <h2>Appearance</h2> Metal roofs can come with a mill finish, for those who favour an industrial look, and also in many colours. The quality and longevity of coloured coatings can vary. The darker the colour, the lower the solar reflectance and the higher the cooling loads. \
A mill finish Galvalume roof does not appeal to everyone. It looks shiny and its industrial look does not suit all styles of buildings. It might look a bit like a barn but that is fine by me. It looks like the kind of roof that architects would put on their own home. I expect a mill finish Galvalume roof would start shiny but would age over time to a medium grey patina. \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233
\cf0 Asphalt shingle roofs look fine when they are new. However, when they are at the end of their lifespan they curl and fade and do not look very good. A journey through some of the poorer neighbourhoods of Hamilton or Lackawanna, NY will show you how age treats older asphalt shingle roofs: they do not age gracefully. I have seen asphalt roofs that are only eight years old that have begun to take that slide into decrepitude. This seems like very poor value for your money. <h2>Disadvantages of metal roofs</h2> Admittedly, there are some real disadvantages to metal roofs: <ul> \
\pard\pardeftab720\li710\sl231
\cf0 <li>Expense: they always are going to cost more than shingles</li> <li>Availability: it takes some effort to find a roofer who can install one</li> <li>Noise: if there is a gap between the roof deck and metal a resonating chamber could form that can make quite a \
\pard\pardeftab720\fi-710\ri0\sl233
\cf0 racket during a hail or rain storm</li> <li>Prominence: metal roofs, especially if they are shiny, will make your house stand out from others on your street</li> \
\pard\pardeftab720\fi710\sl231\sa230
\cf0 <li>Snow shedding: snow on your roof can form a large mass which could slide from your roof all at once and damage vehicles or people beneath</li> </ul> <h2>Why are asphalt shingle roofs so common on houses in North America?</h2> If you look over the residential roofscapes of Hamilton, or any other North American city, all you see are asphalt shingle roofs. Why is this? Hamilton is a steel city that even produces Galvalume sheeting in its steel mills. Where are all the metal roofs? \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl231
\cf0 Some possible reasons why asphalt shingle roofs are so common: <ul> <li>Expense: asphalt roofs for normal residential buildings are the cheapest solution. Initial costs are a deciding factor for many</li> <li>Shifting the expense to the next owner: people put on new roofs and anticipate that they will not own the house \
\pard\pardeftab720\li710\fi-710\sl233
\cf0 when it is time to replace the roof</li> <li>Familiarity: everyone seems to get a asphalt shingle roof when they need to replace a roof</li> <li>'Big' asphalt and availability: roofers who can re-roof your house quickly with asphalt shingles are everywhere. \
\pard\pardeftab720\fi-710\ri0\sl233
\cf0 Standing-seam or other metal roofers are much less common and much harder to find</li> <li>Home building industry: new home builders like to reduce their costs, in the absence of a perceived demand for a higher quality product</li> \
\pard\pardeftab720\fi710\sl231\sa230
\cf0 <li>Absence of green policy: lack of government or policy incentives to encourage greener, longer-lasting residential roofs</li> </ul> <h2>More expensive but not <em>that</em> much more expensive</h2> Art's price for standing-seam was about 25% more than the highest quote for a conventional roof. This doesn't seem like much more to pay for what seems like a much higher quality product, especially when the environmental benefits are factored in. \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233
\cf0 By way of example, you can buy an inexpensive new car for about $14,000. 25% over that price would be $17,500. Say you were deciding between a cheap car for $14,000 or $17,500 for the greenest car available, which would last two or three times as long and establish you as a person who votes for green initiatives with their wallet. I think most people would go for the more expensive product, if they could afford it. \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233\sa230
\cf0 What surprised me with my experience of pricing standing-seam roofs was not how expensive Art's roof would be but rather how small the difference would be over a conventional shingle roof. If I had just a little bit more money - and it disturbs me that I don't - I would spring for Art's standing-seam roof. I have chosen instead to put on a much cheaper metal roof (almost half the price of Art's). This roof will look similar in that it is made of Galvalume Plus but has exposed fixings. This means that across the roof there are holes in the surface of the metal, as opposed to concealed fixings where holes are hidden beneath a layer of metal. Metal roofs with exposed fixings are commonly found on barns in rural parts of Ontario. If I'm lucky this roof should look fine, keep out the rain and may last about 25 years. \

\cf0 For those in the Hamilton or Niagara region of Ontario looking for a top-quality standing-seam metal roofer, I suggest you call Art Barker at (905) 296-2102.]]></content:encoded> \

\pard\pardeftab720\sl233\sa230
\cf0 On Sept 19, 2009 the boys and I attended a gathering of the Human Powered Transportation Association (<a id="uxv9" title="HPTA" href="http://www.hptabrant.ca/velo2009.htm" target="_blank">HPTA</a>) at <a id="mxk6" title="Reg Rodaro" href="http://vaxxine.com/regrodaro/" target="_blank">Reg Rodaro's</a> property near Niagara-on-the-Lake. Here we saw several velomobiles up-close, both hand-made and factory-built. The Toronto firm <a id="bres" title="Bluevelo" href="http://bluevelo.com/" target="_blank">Bluevelo</a> had an excellent showing of their wares. The crowd was extremely friendly and welcoming. We had to leave early but would have liked to have stuck around. In the brief time we were there I had several stimulating conversations, plus the barbecue scheduled later in the day looked very promising. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl233\sa230
\cf0 Velomobiles are fully enclosed bicycles, or more commonly tricycles. They solve two problems with cycling: getting wet and cold in bad weather, and falling over when you stop moving. Currently, they are still a bit of a fringe pursuit but I predict this will soon change, especially if they become a bit less expensive (they now cost about $7,500 CAD and up). Otherwise, they look and perform like something that many thousands would love to own. They are practical, green vehicles, especially in places with little snow and ice. Due to their aerodynamic shape, they make cycling much easier, especially at speeds over 25 kph. They require no license or insurance and are classified as bicycles in Canada. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl231\sa230
\cf0 The production costs of velomobiles would decrease if demand for them increased. If ten times as many people wanted them, then economies of scale would start to take over. Research and development in the human-powered transportation sector is important to giving this industry greater resources and industrial credibility. Governments should encourage such research. Another way to reduce costs is to support those interested in building kit bodies on top of factory-built recumbent trikes (which are more common than velomobiles). \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233
\cf0 Development of recumbent trikes (the inner workings of most velomobiles) is well advanced. It seems like it's the bodies that need a bit of work (although the body on the <a id="eyz6" title="Quest" href="http://en.velomobiel.nl/quest/" target="_blank">Quest</a> model by Velomobiel.nl is oh-so-gorgeous). Many of the technologies applicable in building kayaks are transferable to the building of bodies for velomobiles. Canada has a long history in the building of kayaks, and the velomobile market could conceivably be a larger market than that for kayaks. Kayak-building techniques such as molded fiberglass, Kevlar, skin-on-frame, and stitch-and-glue seem promising. <h2>Possible business models for Velomobiles</h2> <ul> \
\pard\pardeftab720\fi710\ri0\sl233
\cf0 <li>As mobile billboards: velomobiles generate considerable interest when driven around town: "Buy a velomobile. Lease out advertising on both sides &lt;your web address here!&gt; and cover the payments for the velomobile through advertising rents"</li> \
\pard\pardeftab720\fi710\sl231
\cf0 <li>As tourist attractions: "1 hour in a velomobile for only $25!"</li> \
\pard\pardeftab720\li710\sl231
\cf0 <li>As amenities for green hotels: "Guests can ride our complimentary velomobile!"</li> \
<li>As attractions at street fairs: "See the amazing velomobile rodeo!"</li> \
\pard\pardeftab720\fi710\sl231
\cf0 <li>As basic, green transportation: "Carry all your groceries, laugh at the rain and smirk at the snow!"</li> \
<li>As an industry that might convince people that Canada actually has green aspirations: "Ontario, now with a velomobile industry second only to the Netherlands!"</li> </ul>]]></content:encoded> \

Every once in awhile a newspaper article is published that extols the charms of Pittsburgh as a tourist destination. I enjoy reading such articles because Pittsburgh is wonderful city for which I feel great affection. However, lately, there is a sameness to the articles and their manufactured, somewhat contrived message that now seems a little suspect. \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233\sa230
\cf0 Usually these articles go something like this: <blockquote>You might think that Pittsburgh is a real stinking dump but this no longer true! It is actually a very liveable city with some colourful restaurants, great museums and lots of people who don't seem to mind living there at all! When the Steel mills were operating Pittsburgh was known as 'the Smoky City.' Air quality was terrible and they had to turn on the street lights at noon. Then all the mills shut down in the 70's and now the air is much better. There are lots of new industries such as health care, research and robotics. Pittsburgh really is quite a cool city--even Andy Warhol came from there! </blockquote> All of the above is true. The Pittsburgh revival is real and it is a city filled with interesting, friendly people. Its universities can be excellent (e.g. Carnegie Mellon). The museums are well worth a visit, for example, the Warhol, the Carnegie and the Children's Museum. Some of its neighbourhoods are very attractive and vibrant. As in Buffalo, it is surprising just how beautiful some of its architecture is. <h2>The conventional interpretation</h2> What these articles tend to suggest is the following: that dirty industries and the jobs they provide are bad, while clean, white-collar research jobs are much better--for all concerned; that the steel industry left town all at once in the 70's. This was bit hard at first but it appears that it's been a good thing in the long run; that the dirt that the steel industry produced was an inevitable outcome of steel production and that the only way to clean up the environment was to get rid of that type of industry entirely; and finally, that whatever was lost during the period of de-industrialization during the 70's and 80's has been replaced with something of equal or greater value. <h2>Some things to consider</h2> What these articles tend not to mention is that one of the reasons that housing is so cheap and artists' studios in cool industrial spaces are so available in Pittsburgh is that hundreds of thousands of people left town, never to return. Depopulation of the once vibrant industrial city of Pittsburgh was an extraordinarily painful process for many, especially for those unlikely to find work in any type of new, research-based economy. This dislocation of one group of people with another, where the overlap between the two groups is minimal, was a socially corrosive experience for those made redundant. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl231\sa230
\cf0 Many neighbourhoods in Pittsburgh have yet to recover from de-industrialization. These may be far from the relatively urbane ones such the Golden Triangle (downtown), Lawrenceville, or Bloomfield, where some new investment has trickled in. The pain in less-glamorous neighbourhoods, such as Munhall, Wilmerding, or McKeesport, still appears raw and unresolved. \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233\sa230
\cf0 Pittsburgh still tends to be a highly segregated city according to race. The Hill District, for example, is essentially a black ghetto within walking distance of downtown. It attracts little investment, is not a place you want to explore late at night and is under no danger of being gentrified anytime soon. The racism which presumably perpetuates such ghettos is as powerful a force as recent attempts at civic reinvention. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl233
\cf0 The speed at which de-industrialization occurred to the steel industry in Pittsburgh always seemed a bit fishy. Why did it happen so quickly? Can it be explained by market forces (e.g. cost of labour, materials or transportation) or are there other, possibly more sinister factors such as avoidance of environmental regulation, or the desire to set up shop in locales without pesky, activist unions? If Hamilton, Ontario can still be making steel, why is it that thirty years ago Pittsburgh decided that it couldn't do the same?]]></content:encoded> \

\cf0 Hamilton has the reputation of being a classic rust-bucket city with an economy excessively dependent on heavy industry. It is seen by its critics as an unclean, rough and slightly dangerous place, where reckless civic decisions are made behind closed doors. It is the Golden Horseshoe's version of the dark Satanic mills of industrial England combined with the interethnic tensions of a seething, immigrant-fueled city like Chicago. \

\pard\pardeftab720\sl233\sa230
\cf0 Burlington on the other hand is a classic North American bedroom community, where the ills of post-Victorian society have been scrubbed clean and suburban comforts can be enjoyed guilt-free. In Burlington, civic decision-making is seen as more sober, with less chance of overt corruption. By moving from Hamilton to Burlington people could avoid industrial blight, poverty, intractable social problems and historical decay. Hamilton has industrial production, including steel, as its native industry. In Burlington the native industries are suburban tract housing and real estate development. Hamilton is left-leaning politically while Burlington is right-leaning. Hamilton is Scorsese's <em>Mean Streets</em> while Burlington is more <em>Leave it to Beaver</em>. <h2>History of building</h2> One important axis in which Hamilton/Burlington differ is that of history. Hamilton has lots of history while Burlington appears to have very little. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl231\sa230
\cf0 In Hamilton, history cannot be marginalized simply because there is so much of it. From mid-Victorian churches, to worker's cottages, to aging factory complexes, history--as far as architectural infrastructure is concerned--is in great supply. However, demand for this history does not correspond to the abundance of its supply. \
As in many historical industrial cities, the historical richness of the place is confounded with its current, marginal economic value. This tends to grossly undervalue these resources. With diminished value, old dilapidated buildings are destroyed without outcry. A movement to create money from these old bricks, say, through industrial tourism as found in England and Germany, has yet to appear. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl233\sa230
\cf0 Burlington was purposely built to escape history and to start afresh. Nowhere in Burlington is there much evidence of settlement prior to, say, 1900. Burlington first grew as a post-war bedroom community to Hamilton. It has shifted its focus to being more a bedroom community to Toronto, or a viable edge city in its own right. Burlington also has a surprisingly diverse industrial corridor along the busy QEW, which divides Burlington in two. \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233
\cf0 Burlington is presented as a modern solution to a traditional Victorian city like Hamilton: in order to build the modern city it was necessary to escape the burdens of the past. Burlington encourages one to forget about history and focus more on consumption. Residents move there not in spite of the lack of historical context but rather because of it. \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233\sa230
\cf0 <h2 style="text-align: left;">History of ethnic enclaves</h2> When immigrants move to a rough and tumble place like Hamilton, the resources provided by ones ethnic community and church are a vital source of support. In the absence of money, support comes from the community. Immigrants often live near their supportive communities in urban enclaves. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl233\sa230
\cf0 Hamilton has the remnants of urban enclaves, such as the Italian and Portuguese North End. However, these are losing its ethnic flavour as residents acquire sufficient mobility to move to cleaner, relatively bucolic suburbs like Burlington. As older communities move on, newer ethnic communities like the Vietnamese or Somalis take their place. \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233\sa230
\cf0 Burlington was from the start a post-ethnic type of place. In Burlington, support comes less from community and more from cash-in-hand. In Burlington, the average household income is much higher than in Hamilton. The more money you have, the less dependent you are on support from your community. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl233\sa230
\cf0 In Burlington there is ethnic diversity in the population, since like Hamilton, it has inflows of immigrants. But you would not know this from driving around town. Neighbourhoods in Burlington tend to look all the same. There is some differentiation in neighbourhoods, but this is caused more by variations in income than in ethnic make up. <h2>Avoidance of poverty and ambiguity</h2> To move to Burlington, due to its elevated property prices, you need to earn a certain income. This is a crude stereotype, of course, but as a general rule being a resident of Burlington indicates a certain base household income. This means that if you move to Burlington you can successfully avoid much contact with the urban poor. For some, this is an attractive proposition. \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233\sa230
\cf0 In Hamilton, the chance of poverty avoidance is much reduced. Hamilton, like Buffalo and Pittsburgh, has lots of poor people. But there are also considerable numbers of not-poor people too. Therefore, saying you are a resident of Hamilton imparts less information than saying you live in Burlington. In Hamilton you might be poor, or you might not be. You might be living there because you have no other options, or you might be there by choice. This ambiguity of rank and position creates opportunities to move between social strata. \
In larger cities such as Toronto and New York, enormous wealth lives side by side with striking poverty. Diversity of income and circumstance are the marks of most traditional cities. Hamilton is traditionally urban in this respect: if you want to avoid poverty then Hamilton is not your kind of place. Burlington is the opposite: if you want to avoid poverty, Burlington might be just the place for you. <h2>Property maintenance and social diversity</h2> One striking difference between Hamilton and Burlington is their approach to property maintenance. Hamilton is full of buildings that require huge amounts of maintenance. Their bricks need re-pointing, parapets are falling down, flashings are corroded and need to be replaced. Typically, this maintenance work is done inadequately, presumably because of the huge expense of doing it well. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl233\sa230
\cf0 Burlington, on the other hand, is perhaps overly-maintained--despite being a place where low or no-maintenance finishes such as vinyl siding are common. Burlington is full of house-proud home-owners who edge their lawns and power-wash their car-ports to an itch of their lives. There is a great sense of keeping up your property so that the neighbours have no reason to complain. In Burlington, with its relatively homogeneous population, there is concern about what neighbours might think. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl233
\cf0 In Hamilton, with its more diverse population, there is less concern to conform in this way because there is less likelihood your neighbours are similar to you.]]></content:encoded> \

\cf0 Toronto's Nuit Blanche happened on the night of October 3-4. It was a great success. We saw some good art and left feeling happy. <h2>Crowds</h2> It is the density of crowds that makes Nuit Blanche a worthwhile event, almost regardless of what is exhibited in the galleries. The event attracts crowd-lovers and repels crowd-haters. The crowds are diverse in age, but the physicality of the event tends to favour the young. Black is a common colour of dress. Brightly-dressed individuals stand out from the crowd. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl231\sa230
\cf0 The density of sidewalk interactions in Toronto is usually fairly modest. Nuit Blanche ups this density considerably, for a limited time. But the scale of Nuit Blanche is so vast that this density occurs only in relatively small pockets of the city. In the rest of town it is business as usual. <h2>Physical exertion</h2> To attend Nuit Blanche involves strenuous, physical activity. It takes lots of energy to visit the various venues and districts. We stayed in one district only (Queen St West near Ossington), left early (2am), but even this was tiring. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl233\sa230
\cf0 At Nuit Blanche, walking is the preferred mode of transportation. Leave the bicycle or car at home this night, since these become cumbersome when the crowds become dense. The distance between districts in Nuit Blanche is so great that walking between all of them would exhaust most people. Therefore, an all-night Transit pass is a good investment. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl231\sa230
\cf0 However, even with a Transit Pass, Nuit Blanche has become an event so large that it can't really be experienced in total by one individual. It's just too physically exhausting to see it all. \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233\sa230
\cf0 Attending Nuit Blanche means staying up late. This is hard on some people's bodies. I found it difficult to assemble enough energy to leave the house, at a time when my thoughts focus more on slipping into bed. \
A good idea is to eat a substantial meal during the middle of Nuit Blanche so your body has more to work with. There were several attractive restaurants on our path and we ate in a good Chinese one. <h2>Costs of success</h2> Nuit Blanche is a large, far-flung event that is growing quickly. In Toronto, there is high demand for what it offers, within a certain segment of the population. As Nuit Blanche grows and becomes more popular, some people may become troubled by its scale. With this scale it is difficult to know what to do because there are so many options. Given a set of interests, it is difficult to know what particular events are best-suited to these interests. \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233
\cf0 Distance is also a potential weakness of Nuit Blanche. Walking is the only feasible means of transportation within each district. Yet, it can be physically exhausting to travel between districts. Therefore, a comprehensive shuttle system is needed between districts, beyond that which is offered by public transit. In this respect Nuit Blanche could become a huge, metropolitan version of what is currently offered by Hamilton's <a id="b67l" title="Art Bus" href="http://thepearlcompany.ca/?page_id=4" target="_blank">Art Bus</a>.]]></content:encoded> \

\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl233\sa230
\cf0 attentional deficit issues. Here are some tricks I have learned to help reduce my cognitive overload when writing and editing: \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233
\cf0 <p> &nbsp; </p> <h3><strong>Express yourself first, edit later</strong></h3> <ul> \
\pard\pardeftab720\li710\sl231
\cf0 <li>Don't expect the first expression of an idea to be elegant, well-formed, or to make any sense</li> <li>Through skillful editing, silk purses can be made from sow's ears</li> <li>The writing/editing process is highly iterative; don't be surprised if it takes time</li> \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233
\cf0 </ul> <h3>Writing as a tool for thinking</h3> <ul> \
\pard\pardeftab720\li710\sl231
\cf0 <li>As you write you might start to think about things in a new way</li> <li>It may be difficult to predict where a document might lead before you actually write it</li> <li>This emergent aspect is what makes writing exciting</li> \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233
\cf0 </ul> <h3>Mechanical editing</h3> <ul> \
\pard\pardeftab720\fi710\ri0\sl233
\cf0 <li>A large part of editing is mechanical or technical and thus could, in theory, be automated (that is, any monkey could be trained to do it)</li> \
\pard\pardeftab720\fi710\sl231
\cf0 <li>Such editing need not be too difficult conceptually</li> </ul> <h3>Good content requires more than technique</h3> <ul> \
<li>Even with perfect technical editing, there is no guarantee that the content of writing will have any value</li> </ul> <h3>Number of words</h3> <ul> \
<li>If you can express the same thought in fewer words, then use fewer words</li> \
<li>However, don't be too miserly with words; excessive density or compactness of writing should be avoided</li> </ul> <h3>Contiguity of similar ideas</h3> <ul> \
\pard\pardeftab720\li710\sl231
\cf0 <li>Put ideas that are similar, next to one another, using cut and paste</li> <li>If there is repetition, then get rid of something</li> <li>Don't say the same thing in different parts of the same document, except occasionally for rhetorical effect</li> \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233
\cf0 </ul> <h3>Order and flow</h3> <ul> \
\pard\pardeftab720\fi710\sl231
\cf0 <li>Often, sufficient ideas are present in a document but are not in the proper order</li> \
<li>Put ideas in the proper order so that they flow well and unfold elegantly</li> </ul> <h3>Conclusions</h3> <ul> \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl233\qj
\cf0 <li>If you make a conclusion using words such as 'therefore' or 'so', you should support your conclusion with a progression of plausible assertions</li> \
\pard\pardeftab720\fi710\sl231
\cf0 <li>Don't assume, as a given, what you are tying to prove</li> \
<li>Sometimes lines of reasoning lead to crazy conclusions; sometimes such conclusions turn out to be true</li> </ul> <h3>Avoid conclusions if necessary</h3> <ul> \
<li>Often the available evidence is too sketchy or ambiguous to make firm conclusions</li> \
<li>Asking the right questions might be a worthwhile contribution</li> </ul> <h3>Back to front structure</h3> <ul> \
<li>If you come to an interesting conclusion at the end of a document, it might be a good idea to put that idea at the beginning so people have some idea where you are headed</li> </ul> <h3>Hidden assumptions</h3> <ul> \
\pard\pardeftab720\fi710\ri0\sl231
\cf0 <li>Hidden assumptions are things assumed to be true without their existence being acknowledged and with no evidence of their truthfulness provided</li> \
\pard\pardeftab720\fi710\sl231
\cf0 <li>Try to identity and examine hidden assumptions; this can often be an interesting and fruitful enquiry</li> </ul> <h3>Knowledge as 'frozen ignorance'</h3> <ul> \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl233
\cf0 <li>Often things that 'everyone knows' turn out not to be true</li> <li>Assume that your ignorance of the world is much greater than your knowledge</li> </ul>]]></content:encoded> \

\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl231\sa230
\cf0 During last Saturday's Nuit Blanche in Toronto, my wife Cornelia Peckart taught me some interesting lessons about participatory art events and art 'happenings.' \
Cornelia's idea was to create an <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/michaeljcumming/LootBagForArtCorneliaPeckartNuitBlancheToronto?feat=directlink" target="_blank">art event</a> that involved people walking by, in which participants were rewarded for their participation. The reward was a 'loot bag,' much like those given out at children's birthday parties. The event in which people were encouraged to participate involved drawing with chalk on the brick wall along the east side of the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, at the corner of Queen St West and Shaw in Toronto. Prior to the event, Cornelia did not request permission from the institution to chalk up their wall (it is easier to ask forgiveness than to get permission). \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233\sa230
\cf0 The event was almost completely spontaneous. Cornelia didn't know if she would have enough nerve to go through with it just moments before she set up and began to rally the crowds. She didn't know where she would set up until she happened to see an available wall. The time from when the project was first conceived to when it occurred was very short--only a few hours. Due to the enthusiasm of Cornelia, which is usually seen as a gift given freely, the event was a success. My role was as the event photographer. It was fun for me as well. \
Here are some of the lessons I learned, which I believe are applicable to a wider context: <h2>Tangible rewards encourage participation</h2> People who are accosted and asked to participate in an art happening during events like Nuit Blanche may be reluctant to do so unless they are assured of a few things: that they will not be too embarrassed by the experience, that they will probably have some fun, and that there is some tangible award for participating (although this reward need not be substantial). Having this reward made the difference between people walking by and people deciding to take part. <div> <h2>Crowds can form and disperse very quickly</h2> [caption id="attachment_290" align="alignright" width="240" caption="Crowd scene at Queen and Shaw, Toronto"]<img class="size-full wp-image-290" title="Crowd scene at Queen and Shaw, Toronto" src="http://www.michaelcumming.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/PA045076.JPG" alt="Crowd scene" width="240" height="180" />[/caption] \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233
\cf0 One the most interesting aspects of the experience was just how quickly crowds formed once people figured out that something was going on. It didn't require a long build-up time or an organic period of growth. It happened almost instantly and it disappeared just as quickly as it appeared. It was a completely ephemeral event. It took about 45 minutes from start to finish. Once all the loot bags were given out then the event was over and no one knew that anything had happened, besides chalk scratchings on the wall. Despite this ephemeral quality we got the sense that people valued their participation, that their interaction was meaningful to them and their apparent enjoyment was genuine. After the event, we continued on our way and explored more of Nuit Blanche, like nothing had happened. <h2>The Power of Charisma</h2> One of the reasons that the event was a success was that Cornelia was charismatic and attracted a crowd, simply through her interactions and presence. This factor was crucial. This skill in rallying crowds quickly is found in few people. If I had attempted a similar event it wouldn't have worked at all. \

\cf0 When it comes to art events, appeals to reason are often much less powerful than appeals to having fun and getting a little bit of loot. \

\cf0 <content:encoded><![CDATA[I eagerly anticipated the James St Supercrawl held Friday Oct 9, 2009. Unfortunately, the weather didn't cooperate in the least. It was raining heavily all day. After listening to music for a short time at the Supercrawl and visiting a couple of galleries, I walked home because I was getting cold. I have heard from others that it was a good party. I had obviously left much too early. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl231\sa230
\cf0 For the Supercrawl, James St North was closed to traffic between York/Wilson and Cannon. This moved the centre of gravity of the event a couple blocks south. Usually, most Art Crawl action happens between Cannon and Barton. Moving it southwards made the Sonic Unyon building on Wilson feel more central, which during normal crawls feels like an outlier. Several live music stages had been set up. Covered stages were necessary that night because otherwise musicians and equipment would have become completely drenched. The wet weather discouraged crawling along James St. It appeared that fewer galleries than normal were open. The Loose Canon Gallery, as is usually the case, had some of the most interesting art on display. The you me gallery, which is often our first port of call, was closed. \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233\sa230
\cf0 The Art Crawl is primarily a linear event, much like that portion of Nuit Blanche that runs along Queen St West in Toronto. On the strip lots is going on. Off the strip the neighbourhoods are quiet. In my opinion the Art Crawl should include more of James Street, both North and South. It should stretch all the way between Liuna Station at Murray to St Joseph's Hospital. It this way it would include most of the urban highlights of downtown Hamilton, including Gore Park. The Art Crawl has a way to go before there are sufficient attractions to encourage people to tramp all this way, but one can dream. \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233
\cf0 To attract crowds to the Supercrawl (which it sounds like they were successful in doing) live music became the main attraction. Overall, this made it less of an art-focused event. This may have been because of the weather or it may have been by design. Although live music is enjoyable to see anywhere in the city (the Locke St Festival is especially good in this respect) I'm not sure how successfully live music on fixed stages relates to the pedestrian movement inherent to an Art Crawl. With an Art Crawl you want people to promenade and explore art venues; with fixed music stages you want people to stop and listen to music. Therefore, the Supercrawl for me was like a regular Art Crawl, but with less crawling and less art.]]></content:encoded> \

\pard\pardeftab720\sl233\sa230
\cf0 The weekend of October 17-18, 2009 was the last weekend of Doors Open 2009 events in Ontario. The boys and I decided to visit the small town of Smithville, which is a small farming community on the upper plateau of the Niagara Escarpment about 12 kilometers south of Grimsby. In Smithville, among the open sites, were the Smithville Train Station and the Smithville Presbyterian Church. <h2>Smithville Train Station</h2> [caption id="attachment_358" align="alignright" width="270" caption="Smithville Train Station"]<img class="sizemedium wp-image-358" title="Smithville Train Station" src="http://michaelcumming.com/wpcontent/uploads/2009/10/Train-Station-300x224.jpg" alt="Smithville Train Station" width="270" height="202" />[/caption] \
The Smithville Train Station was a typical Doors Open site with guides who explained how the train station served the town well over the years, next to the tracks of the T,H &amp; B (Toronto, Hamilton and Buffalo) Railway, later CP Rail. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl231\sa230
\cf0 The station had an attractive circular turret and an interior lovingly restored by the townspeople. It had been moved 50 feet from its previous location, which was directly adjacent to the tracks. Originally, the station had two waiting rooms, one called the Men's Smoking Room and another for women, children and non-smokers. Each waiting room was heated by a pot-bellied stove. \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233\sa230
\cf0 The station did give the impression as being a special place of transition for the town. Most major arrivals and departures of the town occurred through the train station. It was where soldiers departed to fight in overseas wars and where farmers transported their goods to centres of population. You could imagine how immigrants felt when they hopped off the train at Smithville, to start a new life in the wilds of Canada. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl233\sa230
\cf0 The train station obviously holds great resonance for the town and many have devoted countless hours to its restoration. In the basement several women were busy maintaining the town archives. It was obvious that the people of Smithville were proud of their history and took it seriously. \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233\sa230
\cf0 A frequent lesson derived from attending Doors Open events is that maintaining a link to the past through architecture is a meaningful occupation and pastime for many. It adds meaning to their lives, and as a visitor it adds meaning to our lives as we witness people constructing meaning in theirs. <h2>Smithville Presbyterian Church</h2> [caption id="attachment_355" align="alignright" width="270" caption="Smithville Presbyterian Church"]<img class="sizemedium wp-image-355" title="Smithville Presbyterian Church" src="http://michaelcumming.com/wpcontent/uploads/2009/10/smithvilleChurch2-300x224.jpg" alt="Smithville Presbyterian Church" width="270" height="202" />[/caption] \
The second site we visited, the Smithville Presbyterian Church turned out to be one of those special Doors Open sites in which we walked out feeling completely satisfied, indeed almost overwhelmed by the experience. With Doors Open, you never know quite what you are going to get and the visit to the Smithville Presbyterian Church was a prime example of this. We went in with no expectations and were rewarded with a rich, yet compact experience. \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233
\cf0 At the door, several friendly church women greeted us. We then proceeded to a display that honoured the men and boys who had left Smithville to fight in overseas wars. Included was a display of military rifles with fixed bayonets, which greatly \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233\sa230
\cf0 impressed the boys. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl233\sa230
\cf0 Later, I spoke with two church elders [meaning, a couple of guys about my age] about the history of the Presbyterian Church, its origins in Scotland and how branches of this Protestant denomination went through a dizzying array of splits, secessions and mergers. \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233\sa230
\cf0 In the 19th century the Presbyterian Church was the most important Protestant denomination in English Canada. Many parts of English Canada were settled by people of Scottish descent. Usually these Scots were Protestants. Scottish Protestants built some very handsome limestone and brick churches in Ontario, like the one in Smithville. \
Then we discussed the architectural history of the main Presbyterian churches in nearby Hamilton. There are three important Presbyterian churches in Hamilton: St Paul's Presbyterian on James St South at Jackson, MacNab Street Presbyterian on MacNab near the train tracks, and the large Central Presbyterian at Charlton and Caroline. Central seems to be the largest of the three and the one most successful in maintaining a healthy congregation. All three are architecturally and culturally significant and are well worth a visit during Doors Open events. The stained glass windows in St Paul's and MacNab are particularly noteworthy. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl231\sa230
\cf0 An important event, apparently, in Presbyterian Church history, was the formation of the United Church of Church in 1925. The majority of Presbyterians at that time decided to join the new church. But some decided not to join and remained as Presbyterians. It is unclear what sorts of people stayed compared to those who left. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl233\sa230
\cf0 I think it is this aspect that makes the history of the Presbyterian Church in Canada difficult for outsiders to comprehend. Like in many Doors Open events, a glimpse is given of a world you realize you know next to nothing about. \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233
\cf0 After my discussions with the elders, I had several questions which would have taken them a long time to explain to me adequately: <ul> \
\pard\pardeftab720\fi710\ri0\sl233
\cf0 <li>How did the Scottish Protestant church relate to the Roman Catholic church at the time of the Reformation-why were the ideas of John Knox or John Calvin so revolutionary at the time?</li> \
\pard\pardeftab720\li710\sl231
\cf0 <li>What issues of faith and worship inspired factions to break away from established Protestant churches?</li> \
<li>What did the formation of the United Church of Canada mean to the established churches of the time?</li> \
\pard\pardeftab720\fi710\sl231\sa230
\cf0 <li>What sorts of Presbyterians decided not to join the United Church of Canada?</li> </ul> I guess what I'm looking for is a book called a <em>Scottish Protestantism in Canada for Dummies</em> that might explain these issues for me. \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233\sa230
\cf0 After my discussion of church history with the elders, which lasted some time, some other women demonstrated the beautiful late-Victorian pipe organ, built by Edward Lye &amp; Sons, which has been in continuous operation since 1891. The boys had a great time working the manual bellows (an electric blower was later installed) and in pounding the keyboard of this organ. Liam was especially impressed by the organ's foot pedals and how it was possible to play a tune just by using your feet. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl233\sa230
\cf0 Since the organ still has manual bellows it can be played without electrical power--as happened during a concert in the middle of a power outage in 1999. The majestic sound coming from a church organ was impressive. The organ and its lore occupied the boys for a long time and I think it will be something they remember. \

\cf0 Lastly, the event which cemented this visit as being an important event in Doors Open for us (and the last event we attended in 2009) was the free lunch given by the church ladies in the second floor balcony. There, the boys and I could choose from four different types of soup, eat as many sandwiches and dessert squares as we wanted, drink pots of coffee, tea or juice, all for free. There is little that gives a more positive impression for the boys and me than tasty, free food. \
At Smithville Presbyterian Church we got to enjoy interesting church history, play with on an historic church organ and then get a full meal at the end of it. This hospitality we found was almost overwhelming. It was an excellent advertisement for small-town Presbyterianism as a purveyor of local history and as a place to find a warm, supportive community. \
Despite its cultural attractions, there is a sense that this church community is in decline. Enrolment is declining precipitously in mainstream Protestant churches in Canada. There seems to be a lack of young people required to sustain these communities in the years ahead. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl231\sa230
\cf0 Many potential church-goers are probably happy to visit church buildings and to participate in a supportive community, but lack the Christian faith needed to worship in a Christian church. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl233
\cf0 But, we didn't get the impression that the people we met at the Smithville Presbyterian Church were friendly to outsiders because of their possibly declining congregation--we got the impression that this was just the way they behaved.]]></content:encoded> \

\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl233\sa230
\cf0 [caption id="attachment_364" align="alignright" width="300" caption="Atrium of the Atrium building at MIP"]<img class="size-medium wp-image-364" title="Atrium of the Atrium building at MIP" src="http://michaelcumming.com/wpcontent/uploads/2009/10/PA265252-300x225.jpg" alt="Atrium in the Atrium building at MIP" width="300" height="225" />[/caption] \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl231\sa230
\cf0 The McMaster Innovation Park (MIP) had its official opening on October 26, 2009. I took a tour with several others and found the experience enjoyable and interesting. \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233\sa230
\cf0 MIP is a research park and technology transfer facility whose goal is to take technologies developed at McMaster University and transform them into viable businesses. MIP joins dozens of other university research parks in Canada. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl233\sa230
\cf0 The main building in which the opening took place will be known as the Atrium @ MIP. This renovated building was the former headquarters for the former Westinghouse/<span>Camco</span> facility. In the Atrium the commercialization firm <span>Trivaris</span> is an important tenant, under whose umbrella several local start ups have found support. \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233\sa230
\cf0 A new <span>CANMET</span> (Canadian Centre for Mineral and Energy Technology) building is under construction next door to the Atrium. In this new building CANMET's Materials Technology Laboratory will be housed. This lab appears to be an excellent tenant and anchor for the MIP and will produce over a hundred high-quality research jobs. Such stable, federal agency jobs are a great find for Hamilton and may help turn this part of West Hamilton into a little slice of Ottawa or Kanata. <h2>Observations</h2> The Atrium is an attractively-renovated industrial building with a large, bright atrium. It appears to provide high-quality office and workshop space in a convenient location. The Atrium already houses several high-value and viable-sounding businesses. \
The site plan for the MIP appears ambitious. It may take awhile to build out the entire MIP site since it offers lots of land for expansion. Its proximity to McMaster University, to attractive residential areas, and its convenient highway-side location are advantageous. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl231\sa230
\cf0 MIP represents the capital-intensive end of business development: the kind of innovation that requires significant investment from government, universities or venture capitalists to bring to fruition. \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233\sa230
\cf0 Currently, from an urban design perspective, MIP is relatively isolated from surrounding urban areas. If <span>MIP's</span> site were connected to <span>Frid</span> St it would become much more accessible to the residential and industrial neighbourhoods that lie to the east. \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233
\cf0 The ideas that appear to motivate MIP are the following: \
\pard\pardeftab720\li710\fi-710\sl233
\cf0 <ul> <li>Utilize McMaster R&amp;D as a business resource</li> <li>Focus on areas for which McMaster has research expertise, such as engineering, material science and medical \
technology</li> <li>Support, through R&amp;D, traditional Hamilton industries such as manufacturing and steel production</li> <li>Take an entrepreneurial approach to business development</li> <li>Provide support and infrastructure to growing businesses</li> <li>Follow a business development model of incubation, acceleration and ongoing support.</li> \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233
\cf0 </ul> \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl233\sa230
\cf0 Some of these strategies rely on the prediction that manufacturing and steel production have a future in the region. This, I think is plausible, despite the fact that manufacturing and steel production in the region have been severely hit during the current recession. \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233\sa230
\cf0 I'm not sure, though, that all eggs should be placed in that one basket. <h2>Innovation</h2> The word 'innovation' takes on a slightly civic-booster quality at the MIP. When the word 'innovation' is used in a general, non-specific way it can become a motherhood-type issue that loses meaning and significance. The word 'excellence' is in a similar category: nice to have but just saying it doesn't make it so. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl233\sa230
\cf0 Remember too that innovation is not always required to make money and to create employment. Stelco may not have been the most innovative steel producer in the world but it did employ many people. \
If you are trying to establish a successful university research park, of course, what you profess to encourage is innovation. In all of the other university research parks in Canada innovation is also the method for creating value. But if everyone is doing it, then there is little differentiation from your competition. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl231\sa230
\cf0 Getting true innovation started in a place like MIP is tricky to design and depends on fortuitous blends of interesting research, discoveries that are commercial exploitable and the overall business and social climate in the region. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl233\sa230
\cf0 Innovation also depends on the type of people who end up working at MIP. If they are motivated, connected, well-trained and interesting then innovative work might result; or it might not. Innovation is a difficult quantity to conjure on demand. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl231\sa230
\cf0 In academic settings and in industry innovation is not always encouraged, but combining academic research with industrial production can be a potent combination, as witnessed by successful research parks near Stanford, MIT, Cambridge, Tokyo, etc. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl233\sa230
\cf0 Lacking a real insider's perspective on what is going on at MIP, it is difficult to assess whether what I saw on the tour was innovative or not [with the exception of <a title="Crazy Daisy" href="http://www.crazydaisy.org/" target="_blank">Crazy Daisy</a>, a firm that links awareness of mental health issues with floral design--now that's a cool idea]. <h2>What MIP lacks</h2> [caption id="attachment_366" align="alignright" width="300" caption="View from the Atrium building to CANMET"]<img class="size-medium wp-image-366" title="View from the Atrium building to CANMET" src="http://michaelcumming.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/PA265254-300x225.jpg" alt="View from the Atrium building to CANMET" width="300" height="225" />[/caption] \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233\sa230
\cf0 At MIP, there was little mention of green development or alternative technologies. Canada currently is very weak in these areas, despite the fact that green technologies will likely provide substantial future employment in all developed countries. It is this exclusion that makes the MIP seem much less interesting and progressive than it could have been. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl231\sa230
\cf0 At the MIP Opening there were few cultural, social or community aspects to the project beyond the display of art on the walls. The art I did see seemed like a token inclusion. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl233\sa230
\cf0 What would have been interesting is to see an art installation, involving technology found at MIP, that occupied the entire building atrium. \
Technology and business development appear to be king at the MIP. It appears to be a button-down kind of place. Scruffy artist types, or grad students with wild hair were nowhere to be seen. \
MIP is focused on domains such as material science and biomedical engineering. These are inherently less glamorous and engaging to the popular imagination than research areas such as media arts, green design, artificial intelligence, robotics, etc. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl233
\cf0 However, investment and employment growth do not always require glamour. Many cities earn lots of money working on the dullest things.]]></content:encoded> \

\pard\pardeftab720\li1417\sl233

\f0\fs20 \cf0 <link>http://michaelcumming.com/2009/10/the-aldi-model-of-retailing/</link> <pubDate>Thu, 29 Oct 2009 00:30:56 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator>michael</dc:creator> <guid isPermaLink="false">http://michaelcumming.com/?p=382</guid> <description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[While living in the Netherlands, we became familiar with the <a id="c9uc" \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233\sa230
\cf0 title="Aldi" href="http://www.aldi.com/" target="_blank">Aldi</a> chain of discount grocery stores. Aldi is a German multinational, founded by the German billionaires Karl and Theo Albrecht. Aldi has stores in the States under the Aldi name and also has an up-market version called Trader Joe's. Aldi is not yet in Canada but I expect they will eventually arrive here because their business model is so interesting and their groceries are so inexpensive. The nearest Aldi to us is in Niagara Falls, NY. \
In North America, choice is important. If you want breakfast cereal, then the consumer is given dozens of choices of cereal -- all supposedly differentiated from one another. In the Aldi world, this pattern is reversed and consumers are given extremely limited choice. In many product categories, there is only one offering. For example, if you want a dark chocolate bar, then there may be only be one dark chocolate bar on offer. The brand of this chocolate may not be familiar to you but usually the quality would be comparable, or superior, to brand-name products. <h2>Definition of the Aldi Idea</h2> The Aldi idea is that when shopping for groceries you don't need to have the choice of dozens of similar goods; all you want is one quality product of at a reasonable price. As a result of this restriction of consumer choice Aldi can discount their prices (and reduce their costs) substantially. \
The amount of groceries we could buy for 50 euros at Aldi in Rotterdam was substantial. As a result, grocery shopping for many items at Aldi seemed much more affordable than here in Canada. However, at Aldi the quality of fresh produce was much less than what we find at <a id="e4yg" title="Lococo's" href="http://www.lococos.ca/" target="_blank">Lococo's</a> (a local Hamilton grocer). \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl231
\cf0 The Aldi approach to retailing: <ul> <li>Shoppers don't need a large choice within each product category; they just need one high-quality alternative at a reasonable price</li> \
\pard\pardeftab720\fi710\ri0\sl233
\cf0 <li>Excessive choice, when it comes to groceries, does not bring happiness or empowerment, it brings confusion and unhappiness. This aligns with what the sociologist Barry Schwartz calls the <a id="miig" title="Paradox of Choice" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Paradox_of_Choice" target="_blank">Paradox of Choice</a></li> \
<li>Brand-name products are no better than generic alternatives if the quality of the generics is equal or superior</li> <li>Shopping at a discount grocery store is acceptable to shoppers of various incomes if the quality of the goods is not compromised</li> \
\pard\pardeftab720\fi710\sl231
\cf0 <li>Rules of retailing common to North America can be completely reversed and yet still produce incredible profits for multinationals</li> </ul> <h2>Applying the Aldi Model to other areas</h2> Here, <em>More is Less</em> <ul> \
\pard\pardeftab720\li710\sl231
\cf0 <li>Corn-puff cereals</li> <li>Formulaic pop songs</li> <li>Sitcoms involving blended families</li> <li>Cars on the road</li> <li>People living on earth</li> \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233
\cf0 </ul> <h2>Areas where the Aldi Model works less well</h2> Here, <em>More is More</em> (or, <em>the more the merrier</em>) \
\pard\pardeftab720\li710\fi-710\sl233

\pard\pardeftab720\sl233\sa230
\cf0 This year for Hallowe'en Ben decided to be a Pirate Pickle, while Liam dressed as the Sesame Street character Elmo. \
Ben may have been inspired from the VeggieTales series, or he may have come up with the idea all by himself. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl233\sa230
\cf0 By dressing as Elmo, Liam was motivated by a desire to 'leave childhood behind.' We remain unclear how dressing up as Elmo will further this goal. Liam apparently doesn't even like the Elmo character. We suspect he is working at an ironic level that is beyond our adult understanding. \
The Pirate Pickle had been sprayed with an eco-friendly spray paint applied to bubble-wrap. This paint continues to flake off as we speak, while the Elmo costume was cleverly recycled from a cat costume. To maintain the Pickle's bright green sheen (so it lasts until tomorrow) we may have to re-coat the pickle with eco-unfriendly paint, such as car enamel. \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233
\cf0 After much late-night handiwork by their mother Cornelia, Ben and Liam showed these costumes to their public this morning at school. When dropping off the boys at school it quickly became apparent that a Pirate Pickle held much more resonance with its Grade Four audience than did Elmo (which was discreetly stored in a plastic bag). Ben was like a rock star the instant he stepped out of the car [we chose to drive them to school because of the difficulties in transporting an oversized Pirate Pickle by foot]. Ben hoisted his Pirate Pickle costume on a stick, like a medieval Crusader entering the gates of Jerusalem (which may be an appropriate simile given the Christian message behind the VeggieTales franchise).]]></content:encoded> \

\cf0 <content:encoded><![CDATA[In Saturday's' Globe and Mail there was an interesting <a id="db3o" title="article" href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/health/when-we-began-we-were-almost-pariahs/article1344833/" target="_blank">article</a> by Andr\'e9 Picard about the career of Dr. David Sackett, who pioneered the practice of evidence-based medicine (EBM). EBM promotes the idea that rather than just relying on tradition or expert opinion in medical diagnosis, the proper approach is to find available evidence and then attempt to apply it. This idea seems to make great deal of sense. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl233\sa230
\cf0 I knew little about EBM before I read the article, however, the concept of evidence-based practice (not necessarily as it applies to medicine) is something I have been thinking about for awhile. The EBM concept can probably be applied to all sorts of things. \
EBM is based on the primacy of empirical findings, as opposed to other forms of reasoning. Evidence, as I understand it, forms the foundation of the scientific revolution of the 17th century, following the work of Francis Bacon, Ren\'e9 Descartes and others. Evidence is at the root of science. If there is no empirical evidence then there is no science. \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233\sa230
\cf0 What was interesting about the article is that initially EBM was a controversial idea. It sounds like it remains controversial in some circles. This is surprising. Naively, you might think that EBM would be welcomed with open arms everywhere. For those with no background in medical diagnosis, it is difficult to conceive of a credible alternative to EBM. \
Why then was EBM controversial? The article quotes Sackett: <blockquote>"...all the old guys rejected it [EBM] because it challenged them. All the young guys loved it because it gave them a way to challenge their seniors in a more polite way, instead of telling them they were out of date. In addition, people who are wed to certain policies, if they have already decide what the answer is for an individual or a community, the last thing they want to hear or see is evidence."</blockquote> As Sackett suggests, some factors that may impinge on the rational aspects of scientific practice are <em>patriarchy</em>: older men wanting to maintain their authority regardless of the evidence; <em>careerism</em>: people wanting to promote their careers; and <em>indulgence of egos</em>: placing personal egos above efficacy of treatment or quality of ideas. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl233\sa230
\cf0 Scientists usually try to project an image of rationality--that the scientific method forces them to work strictly from available evidence. This is obviously an idealized portrayal of scientific practice. The work of Popper, Kuhn, and Feyerabend shows how scientific practice can be much messier than the idealized portrayal would suggest. For those familiar with the history of science, it should come as no surprise that people working within scientific domains can sometimes be no more scientific than any other segment of the population. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl231\sa230
\cf0 Scientific evidence often works against our intuition. Evidence can reveal the strangeness and unpredictability of the world. The way the world works is often more complicated than we we usually feel it should be. Truth can often be counter-intuitive. If you rely more on evidence rather than on preconceptions of what ought to be true, then you have to deal with a more complex world. \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233\sa230
\cf0 In addition, there is always the possibility that what you feel you 'know' is built on incorrect ideas or theories. In this case, in order to move forward you may have to takes several step backward and perhaps revise fundamental scientific theories. The history of science is not a linear, progressive cakewalk towards the truth: there may be lots of creative destruction along the way. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl231
\cf0 Most fields, whether scientific or not, depend on evidence to some degree. Architects bring in evidence that suggests their designs will help rather than harm the communities in which they are situated, politicians use evidence to corroborate that their policies will have good consequences rather than bad ones, business people use evidence that their business plans will \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233\sa230
\cf0 end in profitability rather than bankruptcy. \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233
\cf0 In any field this evidence can be manipulated, misrepresented or simply disregarded. Quite often there is available evidence to inform a decision but there is little desire to search for this evidence if the evidence may prove inconvenient for preconceived policies. Scientists are not the only ones who can behave unscientifically.]]></content:encoded> \

\cf0 <content:encoded><![CDATA[The fall of the Wall in 1989 was a joyous occasion for me. I lived in West Berlin in 1981-2 and understood the brutality, ugliness and the simple lack of convenience that the Wall brought to the great city of Berlin. The Wall was an interesting geo-political artifact of the Cold War but it was also very offensive, as walls that imprison populations tend to be. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl231\sa230
\cf0 I visited East Berlin several times when I was living in West Berlin. East Berlin was a strange but fascinating place. At that time I never thought the Wall would fall. I thought that this was just how Berlin was always going to be: a divided city with a curious no-man's land snaking right through its centre. \
Checkpoint Charlie, which was the main crossing into the East, was a wonderfully arcane place of switch-back paths, barbed wire, clanking doors and stern-faced East German border guards. It was like a movie set for all the bad Cold War movies you had ever seen. Checkpoint Charlie was a bit frightening, but it was also so comically repressive it almost fell into self-parody. You almost expected the Monty Python gang to burst in at any moment to perform the Spanish Inquisition sketch. \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233\sa230
\cf0 Once you got into East Berlin, there was an eerie quiet and sense of paranoia. Few people were out on the streets. The goods in the shops were minimal--except that slightly stale loaves of heavy dark bread seemed to be in abundance. The locals were drably dressed and looked at Westerners with suspicion. \
In West Berlin the scene was completely different. It was spread out, almost in a North American style, and had surprisingly large amounts of green space (it still does). It had some comfortable leafy suburbs such as <span>Tegel</span> and <span>Dahlem</span>. The ritzy neighbourhood of <span>Charlottenburg</span> formed its cultural centre. But West Berlin as a city seemed a bit unfocused, in spite of its dominant urban axes such as the <span>Ku'damm</span> and <span>Bismarkstrasse</span>. That was because the true jewels of the city lay east of the Brandenburg Gate in East Berlin. East Berlin held the historical, central core of Berlin and was where most of the grand, old buildings were situated. This is something I had little knowledge of prior to my first visit there. \
In the central district of East Berlin called <span>Mitte</span> there were neoclassical treasures such as the Museum Island and <span>Schinkel's</span> <span>Altes</span> Museum. You ran into these monuments after about a ten minute walk from Checkpoint Charlie. For a naive Canadian the existence of so many massive, historical buildings was very surprising and a bit humbling. But beyond the architectural and urban attractions of the east, East Berlin didn't mean that much to me beyond being a Cold War theme park. I never felt that atomic annihilation between East and West was imminent. I never thought that the Communists were a serious threat to Western Europe. I believed that the next zone of world conflict would be far from the pleasant plains of central Europe. \
But like most other people, I was astounded when the Wall fell. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl231\sa230
\cf0 Right-wing politicians like Reagan, Thatcher and Bush pretended to play some pivotal role in the whole process of the Fall of the Berlin Wall. But I think they just happened to be in power at the time when Communism was falling all on its own. Communist regimes were notorious for their internal weaknesses such as low productivity, low worker morale, environmental degradation, the high cost of feeding an expensive military/police state, and their isolation from natural markets and investment capital in the West. In my opinion, Communism fell because it was spectacularly unsuited for generating wealth and in creating acceptable standards of living for ordinary people, not because of anything ideologically-driven politicians from the West may have said or done. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl233\sa230
\cf0 In its time though, the Berlin Wall did create much misery. Many who tried to escape over the Wall were shot in the back. The Wall was there to keep East Germans in, not to protect them from outsiders. Life in East Germany was oppressive for all except those with the greyest of personalities. Even more surprising was the fact that East Germany was the most advanced and prosperous of the Communist countries. If life in East Berlin was bad, just imagine how miserable life in Minsk or Wroclaw must have been. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl231\sa230
\cf0 Almost everyone was overjoyed when the Wall fell in 1989. However, as many commentators have noted, even though the disappearance of the Wall itself was undoubtedly a good thing, the reunification of Germany and the social impact of this reunification has not been all good for all concerned. We could see this foreshadowing during the time we spent in the newly-unified Berlin in 1991: not all was right about reunification, or how it had played out in Berlin. \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233\sa230
\cf0 When the Berlin Wall fell, my wife and I were living in Toronto. About a year later we decided to move to Berlin, which we did in the Spring of 1991. We stayed about six months and then moved back to Canada. We lived in the former East Berlin in an apartment at <a id="l.ls" title="Erbeskopfweg 11" target="_blank"><span>Erbeskopfweg</span> 11</a>, in the Berlin suburb of <span>Nordend</span>, just north of <span>Pankow</span>. It was a charming place in its own way. Our neighbours there had not seen too many Canadians so we were a bit of a novelty. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl231\sa230
\cf0 The fall of the Wall meant that one political system had been taken over completely by another. It was not two systems getting together and working out what would be acceptable to both sides. It was one side having all the cards with the other side having none. A sense of triumphalism emanated from the West: the Communists had lost and the West had won. This sense infiltrated ordinary people, on both sides. \
Triumphalism tends to be a negative emotion. When one country triumphs over the other, the sensibilities of the losing side tend to be given short shrift. The Easterners had suffered since WWII in an unusually repressive police state. Now--even though they could buy as many bananas as they wanted--they had to suffer some more, under their sometimes boorish western neighbour. \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233\sa230
\cf0 We were shocked that the dominant emotion of West Berliners seemed not to be sympathy or compassion for those in the East for having the misfortune of living in a police state for the last 45 years, but rather that of pity or disgust. Time under Communism was seen as wasted time regardless of what people had spent their time doing. How were these poor <span>Ossis</span> going to cope under the so-called rigours of capitalism? Their experience under Communism was considered less than worthless. The failure of the Communist state became the failure of its citizens, regardless of whether they had participated in the repressive regime or not. Victim or oppressor, East Germany had instantly became a country full of losers. \
In the West the fall of the Berlin Wall is usually portrayed as the Easterners rejecting Communism and accepting Capitalism wholeheartedly. Yet, at the time Easterners had little knowledge of the West and the West little real knowledge of the East. East and West Germany had grown apart in the intervening years and had developed strikingly distinct civic cultures. \
Curiously, after the Wall, both sides took it as an article of faith that the model for both sides would be the Western model. This I believe was a mistake. A much happier outcome for both sides would have worked from the premise that despite the horrors of Communism, it was a bit insulting to assume that your marriage partner-to-be had lived a complete lie for the last half-century of her existence. The idea that the West had 'won' and that the East's traditions were of no value lead to some humiliating and corrosive social policies. A stable and equitable union of different peoples should not have the flavour of a shot-gun wedding. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl231\sa230
\cf0 What then could have made the transitions less painful for the East? For one, there should have been negotiations in which both sides had some say about the direction the future union would take. They didn't seem to take nearly long enough in creating a mutually agreeable '<span>pre</span>-<span>nup</span>.' What could have been a joyous reunification of a divided country to me seemed more like a semi-hostile takeover of one country by another with little concern about the feelings of the weaker side. For some reason, at the time it seemed like most East Germans were fine with that. I suspect this was because they were so demoralized by their experience under Communism that they naively believed that the West held all the answers. \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233
\cf0 In the end, perhaps they shouldn't have even joined together into a single state so quickly. If the Czechs and the Slovaks can live reasonably happily in separate countries, why not the East and West Germans? Union and amalgamation sometimes creates as many problems as it solves. \
When we lived in Berlin in 1991 a young Ossi shopkeeper in <span>Prenzlauer</span> Berg asked what we thought of the East. We both replied that the Easterners seemed nicer--much more unassuming and gentle, while many West Germans seemed a bit too loud and arrogant for our taste. I think many people would have felt the same way if ideology were taken out of the equation and the rights and aspirations of ordinary citizens were taken into account. Just a little respect for the lives and traditions of the East by the West would have gone a long way in making German reunification more palatable and less painful for ordinary people.]]></content:encoded> \

\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl233\sa230
\cf0 Hamilton proved not to be a hotbed of republican sentiment last week on November 9, 2009 when Prince Charles, the Prince of Wales and his wife Camilla, the Duchess of Cornwall, visited Dundurn Castle. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl231\sa230
\cf0 Dundurn Castle (completed 1835) was built as the stately home of Sir Allan MacNab, an influential and wealthy settler of Hamilton who just so happens to be the great-great-great grandfather of Camilla. Dundurn Castle is now a well-loved civic museum in west Hamilton. It is one of the most attractive 19th century buildings in Canada and as a museum gives an excellent idea of the upstairs-downstairs life in an early Canadian estate. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl233\sa230
\cf0 Dundurn Castle is located a few blocks from where I live, which made it for me the most convenient royal visit ever. I simply had to stroll over to its grounds and wait for the royal excitement to build. And build it did. Hamiltonians, as it turned out, were very excited to see Charles and Camilla. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl231\sa230
\cf0 We don't get many royal visits here in Hamilton so we didn't know quite what to expect. Would we be dazzled by the celebrity status of the visiting royals [yes!], would the royals make us feel unworthy and unloved and treat us like residents of a simple steel town [no!], would we tire of the artificiality of an heir to a foreign crown visiting a former colony [not at all!]. We lapped it all up. There was nary a voice of dissent; no discouraging words were heard. Overall, it appeared to be a very successful visit. \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233\sa230
\cf0 I think the fact that Dundurn Castle has a direct family connection to Camilla had a positive effect on the mood of the visit. I think it would be impossible to predict this result prior to their visit. Through skill, some shared history and good luck, Charles and Camilla struck gold this time. They encountered something for which all royals must occasionally yearn: an adoring crowd of loyal subjects. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl233\sa230
\cf0 I am by no means a monarchist but I must confess I too enjoyed the royal visit. I enjoyed the fact that it brought publicity and recognition to the charms of Dundurn Castle and Hamilton. Charles and Camilla appeared to be a stable middle-aged couple who are happy in their own skin. They are not glamour-pusses in the manner of Diana but they appeared to be quite skilled at small-talk with the locals, of asking pertinent questions and of understanding to perfection their mind-numbingly ceremonial role. \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233\sa230
\cf0 In anticipation of the royal visit to Canada there were several newspaper articles detailing how Canadians were quite apathetic about the monarchy, didn't think much of Charles, or had no idea that Canada was configured as a constitutional monarchy. But based on my experience during the royal visit, I don't think Charles should worry about his family's future prospects in Canada. Canadians are clearly in no hurry to get rid of their monarchy. There is a greater chance that Canada will vote to become a Vegan Republic or a Bolshevik Protectorate than that it will cease to be a parliamentary democracy with a British monarch as Head of State. The concept of the 'Crown' is deeply embedded in the Canadian system of government and psyche; it would be hard to imagine Canada without it, regardless of what its citizens might think about any one particular heir or monarch. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl233\sa230
\cf0 The whole concept of a 'constitutional monarchy' seems to be a little counter-intuitive. You would think that monarchies would tend to be deeply conservative places, but there are so many exceptions to this rule (e.g. the Scandinavian countries, the Netherlands, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, etc.) that it doesn't appear to hold water. Republics are not necessarily more progressive and can sometimes veer in odd directions, as our neighbour to the south demonstrates. There is some evidence that Canada's position as a stable, sometimes progressive democracy is not only in spite of its monarchist history but also because of it. Or maybe this is just the Kool-Aid talking. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl231\sa230

\pard\pardeftab720\sl233
\cf0 Charles is the scion of a wealthy, multi-national corporation who has spent most of his life waiting to become a king. It appears though that he spends his money in interesting ways. In architectural circles he is notorious for his interventionist and anti-modernist stance, but overall as an heir apparent, he seems harmless enough--perhaps even progressive in some ways. He is a patron of many causes, some of which could directly benefit Canada, such as heritage architecture, urban sustainability, environmentalism, support for disadvantaged youth, organic farming and alternative medicine. Interestingly, the current Conservative government in Ottawa has absolutely no interest in such causes. Clearly, their brand of conservatism is quite different from Charles's.]]></content:encoded> \

\cf0 <content:encoded><![CDATA[In the 'whatever is begun in anger ends in shame' department, Canada risks descending into pariah status with the latest revelations of complicity in torture in Afghanistan. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl233\sa230
\cf0 For all those who had trepidation about the moral implications of Canadian participation in the Afghan war became more nervous with yesterday's headline in newspapers: \
<a id="ewop" title="&quot;All detainees were tortured, all warnings were ignored&quot;" href="http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2009/11/18/diplomat-afghan-detainees.html" target="_blank">"All detainees were tortured, all warnings were ignored"</a> \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233\sa230
\cf0 Wow. This testimony was given by Canadian diplomat and whistle-blower Richard Colvin, to a parliamentary committee in Ottawa. Colvin had served in a diplomatic capacity in Afghanistan for 17 months. This is the first time a government official has made such far-ranging allegations of complicity in torture by the Canadian Forces and the Canadian government. \
There has been suspicion for some time that some Afghani detainees may have been tortured after they were transferred from Canadian to Afghan Army custody. Colvin's testimony suggests that the transfer of detainees -- to probable or certain torture -- was a widespread Canadian practice. If true, it would greatly discredit Canada's conduct in Afghanistan and reduce its legitimacy as an occupying force. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl231\sa230
\cf0 The Canadians Forces apparently detain larger numbers of people in their military operations than do their allies. A large proportion of these detainees may be innocent of any crime. \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233\sa230
\cf0 Clearly, complicity in torture is a war crime. Armies of occupation such as Canada's must follow rules as defined in part by the Geneva Conventions. If Canadian Forces were complicit in the torture of detainees, were aware of their involvement and still allowed the torture to occur, they are guilty of war crimes. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl233\sa230
\cf0 The Conservative government has experienced little political cost from previous torture allegations -- or indeed from the entire Afghanistan war -- from either the Canadian public or the opposition parties. The issue, oddly, gets little traction in Canadian <a id="is3h" title="politics" href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/opinions/our-own-little-abughraib/article1370425/" target="_blank">politics</a>. Previously, the Conservative government has managed to sweep all allegations of complicity in torture under the rug. It is unclear whether, with these new allegations by Colvin, they will be able to continue to do this. \
What these allegations mean for Canada is that they reflect poorly on the political leadership of Canada, on the Canadian Armed Forces and on Canada as a whole. They conflict completely with the commonly-provided narratives about the roles Canadians play in Afghanistan. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl231\sa230
\cf0 Canadian politicians see these allegations as a domestic political issue and have failed to acknowledge their international implications -- such as severe risks to Canada's reputation. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl233\sa230
\cf0 This head-long rush to possible pariah status is an odd, self-defeating behavior on Canada's part. It has similarities to the Canadian government's recent policy on greenhouse gas emissions, which many view as obstructionist, disingenuous and fundamentally lacking in leadership. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl231\sa230
\cf0 One of the main reasons that the Canadian government has given about why Canada invaded Afghanistan in the first place was to raise the human rights conditions for its residents. At first this did not appear to be difficult to achieve given that the previous Taliban regime had an abysmal human rights record and was itself a pariah regime within the international community. \
It now appears that the Karzai government in Afghanistan is breathtakingly-corrupt and has little interest in improving the human rights conditions of Afghans. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl233
\cf0 The NATO occupying forces in combination with the Karzai government may have achieved what would seem to be impossible -- to create a regime worse for the average Afghan than was the previous Taliban regime.]]></content:encoded> <excerpt:encoded><![CDATA[In the 'whatever is begun in anger ends in shame' department, Canada risks \

\cf0 Our family spent the US Thanksgiving weekend in Pittsburgh. We booked a hotel on <a id="at:b" title="priceline.com" href="http://www.priceline.com/" target="_blank"><span>priceline</span>.com</a> (highly recommended) and managed to get a very reasonable deal. Luckily, the hotel--the <a id="sut_" title="Renaissance Pittsburgh" href="http://www.marriott.com/hotels/travel/pitbr-renaissance-pittsburgh-hotel/" target="_blank">Renaissance Pittsburgh</a>--turned out to be stunning as well as affordable. It was by far the best hotel we have every stayed in--or ever expect to stay in. The boys were ecstatic when they saw the sumptuousness of the lobby and the fluffiness of the pillows on our king-size bed. This hotel had been recently restored and had an impressive glass dome in its lobby and marble balconies worthy of the palace of Versailles. We couldn't afford to eat any food in its restaurants or, as it turned out, to use its telephones even for local calls but overall the value was impressive. We suspect that something must be deeply wrong with the new world order when people like us can stay so comfortably in such a fine American hotel for so little money. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl231\sa230
\cf0 Our hotel was in an ideal, downtown location along the Allegheny River waterfront called the 'Golden Triangle.' It was the first time we had ever stayed in downtown Pittsburgh. Pittsburgh has an unusual urban configuration in that its central business district--the Golden Triangle--is relatively isolated from the rest of the city. The Triangle is where the two rivers meet to form the mighty Ohio. As we told the boys, this is where in the old days people drifted lazily down the river--Huck Finn style--all the way to the Gulf of Mexico. Even though Pittsburgh is a northern city, this access to the Mississippi River basin does add some romance to the city's narrative. At one time, Pittsburgh was the 'Gateway to the Continent.' It held a similar role to that of Buffalo--as a trans-shipment hub for a nation bent on Manifest Destiny. \
What is striking about Pittsburgh, which you tend to forget when you've been away from it, is its stunning topography. Pittsburgh is extremely hilly outside of its downtown core. You soon get into the rhythm of driving through valleys, around hills, along ridges and on top of cliffs. Houses in some neighbourhoods are perched precariously on hillsides, which gives them aspects similar to the <span>Amalfi</span> Coast in Italy or those Greek monasteries built on cliffs. At first this topography is disorienting, then you get used to it. When I look at online maps of Pittsburgh I forget how the neighbourhoods I knew are interrelated, but when I am driving around in them, I can remember where routes lead based on muscle memory. \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233\sa230
\cf0 Pittsburgh has the policy of fixing up its downtown core to make it the most attractive part of the city. This policy seems to have worked out well. Fortunately, there were many splendid, historic buildings in the core to fix up. Pittsburgh has re-branded part of its downtown as the 'Cultural District.' There, they have renovated several old movie and vaudeville houses to become venues for live theater and music. The Cultural District holds Pittsburgh's major cultural attractions such as Heinz Hall--home of the Pittsburgh Symphony, the <span>Benedum</span> Center, <span>Byham</span> Theater and the <span>O'Reilly</span> Theater. These venues happened to be a block from our hotel. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl233\sa230
\cf0 [caption id="attachment_493" align="alignright" width="480" caption="Heinz Hall Staircase"]<img class="size-full wpimage-493" title="Heinz Hall Staircase" src="http://michaelcumming.com/wpcontent/uploads/2009/12/HeinzHallStaircase.JPG" alt="Heinz Hall Staircase" width="480" height="360" />[/caption] \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl231\sa230
\cf0 In downtown Pittsburgh there are many instances of interesting civic sculpture and the quality of new and renovated architecture is generally very high. In addition to restored buildings, there are also other civic improvements such as sculpture parks, river walkways, and new state-of-the-art sports stadiums along the Allegheny river. Overall, Pittsburgh has done a very good job of fixing up their downtown and I would say that the quality of design and execution is superior to most things you see in Toronto or Hamilton. Pittsburgh can be a very classy place, which is something that many outsiders might not realize. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl233\sa230
\cf0 In Pittsburgh's Golden Triangle, the remnants from previous eras when Pittsburgh was incredibly prosperous, are everywhere to be seen. Some buildings have splendid cast bronze sculpture, or intricately carved stonework in the Gothic style. Others are clad in cream-coloured terracotta--an extraordinarily elegant and long-lasting building material. These buildings were obviously built to communicate a level of cultural sophistication on the part of their builders. They are as impressive as buildings you might find in New York, Boston or Vienna. \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233\sa230
\cf0 They were built by names such as Carnegie, <span>Frick</span>, Mellon, and Heinz. These are the people who in old cartoons dress in top hats, wear cashmere overcoats and smoke fat cigars. They made incredible amounts of money when Pittsburgh was the centre of steel production for a rapidly-expanding continent. At the time they may have been 'new money' but now they seem as old as the Medici. They built some splendid buildings for their city and therefore gave back to the city in a physically-enduring way. This is somewhat of a different practice than what is done by today's obscenely wealthy, for which these forms of architectural philanthropy are less common. As an architect I enjoy visiting such buildings despite misgivings about the economics and labour relations of Gilded Age capitalism. \
If you live in Pittsburgh and don't work downtown then you probably will not spend much time downtown, even if you have interest in the urban attractions that the downtown has to offer. The suburbs of Pittsburgh spread for miles and this is where most people live. In general, these suburbs are similar to those in any other American city and have little in common with the hard-core urbanity of the Golden Triangle. The people who tend to frequent the downtown seem to be well-off people who work in corporate offices and drive Audi's, poorer black people who also work downtown and who take the bus, and those who attend cultural and sporting events such as football games, plays, and concerts. This gives the tourist a slightly skewed demographic impression of the city. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl233\sa230
\cf0 Pittsburgh's downtown is busy during the work week but it tends to empty of people when the work week ends. Very few people appear to live in the Golden Triangle itself. It lacks the high density pedestrian traffic or residential amenities you might find in Toronto or New York. There is some evidence of higher-end residential development for those who work in corporate towers and wish to live adjacent to their work, but this is a tiny portion of the population. The Golden Triangle seems to lack some basic services for residents. For instance, it does not appear to have many (or any) grocery stores. \
[caption id="attachment_495" align="alignright" width="480" caption="6th Street, Pittsburgh"]<img class="size-full wpimage-495" title="6th Street, Pittsburgh" src="http://michaelcumming.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/6thStreet.JPG" alt="6th Street, Pittsburgh" width="480" height="360" />[/caption] \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl231\sa230
\cf0 Despite the overall attractiveness of the Golden Triangle, it is unclear whether it will ever become a compelling place to live. One reason is that Pittsburgh has many residential neighbourhoods that are attractive, inexpensive and full of residential-type services such as shops, schools and synagogues. Pittsburgh prides itself on the warmth and sociability of its neighbourhoods. The Golden Triangle may be stunning from an architectural perspective but seems to lack this home-town warmth and practicality. Since the border between adjacent neighbourhoods and the downtown is so distinct in Pittsburgh, to live downtown people have to be hard-core urban home<span>steaders to make that jump</span>. In fact, we know no one who lives or has ever lived in the Golden Triangle. This is why staying there briefly, in a fancy hotel, was such a novelty for us. It is an experience that many <span>Pittsburghers</span> have also never had. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl233\sa230
\cf0 Pittsburgh is now a largely post-industrial city with little evidence of heavy industry in its city core. It is unclear what the city makes it money doing these days beyond the usual sources such as universities, hospitals and financial services and whether Pittsburgh is still running on old money or whether new fortunes are being made. \
Despite the fact that its downtown is very attractive and they have managed to convert the Smoky City's downtown into a show place that rivals midtown Manhattan, Pittsburgh is not always an optimistic city. It has the typical rust-bucket maladies of declining population, pockets of extreme poverty, racial segregation and flat employment growth. I sense that the attractiveness of the Golden Triangle may not be indicative of the health of the rest of the city. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl231\sa230
\cf0 Travelling to the USA from Canada is interesting because it is so different from what we are used to. This feeling of difference occurs the minute we cross the USA-Canada border. On one side of this border is one set of rules and expectations and on the other is another. America gives the impression of promises of great wealth and comfort for those who succeed, but also great pain and degradation for those who fail. The wealthier seem wealthier but the poor seem poorer than in Canada. Not being too clear about which of these two categories we fit into, makes us hesitate to move back to Pittsburgh. \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233\sa230
\cf0 One does get the impression that in parts of the USA during this current recession some of the working population is in absolute crisis--more so than in Canada. The USA has never been known for having much of a safety net and this recession seems to be more severe than previous ones. There is greater fear this time that not only is the American economy in rough shape, but also that the position and status that the USA has enjoyed up until now is in some jeopardy. \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233
\cf0 Pittsburgh derives part of its power simply from being situated in the USA. Pittsburgh has direct access to American markets and to American economies of scale. The USA does have a population and an economy that dwarfs that of Canada. As we often thought when we lived in Pittsburgh, the USA may not be better than Canada but it sure seems bigger.]]></content:encoded> \

\cf0 <content:encoded><![CDATA[After lengthy deliberation, using the best minds at his disposal, Obama makes the predictable yet curious decision to escalate the war in Afghanistan. Can anyone spell Vietnam, or Suez? \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233\sa230
\cf0 Quagmires are usually created by modes of thinking that ignore basic aspects of geo-political or common-sense reality. This appears to be the case with the Western-led war in Afghanistan. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl228
\cf0 Why do I think it is a bad idea to escalate this war? <ul> \
\pard\pardeftab720\fi710\sl231
\cf0 <li> War is violent and dehumanizing by its nature and escalating a war tends to increase suffering, destruction and \
\pard\pardeftab720\li710\fi-710\sl233
\cf0 injustice</li> <li>War waged on the premise that it helps those it is directed against is nonsensical</li> \
\pard\pardeftab720
\cf0 The war lacks public support in all countries in which it is being promoted</li> \
The war is unlikely to be won by Western forces</li> \
\
\pard\pardeftab720\fi710\ri0\sl233
\cf0 <li>Governments friendly to occupying forces (such as Karza<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">i's) te</span>nd to lack basic legitimacy within their own populations</li> \
\pard\pardeftab720\fi710\sl231
\cf0 <li> The war is unaffordable for the USA -- a country that is quickly running out of cash and credit</li> \
\pard\pardeftab720
\cf0 It is unrealistic that a Western-friendly government - with any chance of longevity - will be formed in Afghanistan</li> \
The war could easily escalate into a wider regional conflict involving the much more populous country of Pakistan</li> \
The war lacks legitimacy -- it is not a just war and never has been one</li> </ul> We have had seven years of punditry concerning the situation in Afghanistan. This commentary encouraged Western troops to invade an obscure, mountainous and poverty-stricken country in central Asia. Let's review how we got there. \
\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233\sa230
\cf0 After 9/11, most people were shocked that such an attack could happen to the most powerful country in the world. \
It became clear that given the state of American politics at the time that in response some act of butt-kicking would likely be performed by the US military. There was some concern about preventing future attacks, but simple vengeance was an important motivator right from the start. If you provoke the boss, expect some payback. The myth of redemptive violence, which so animates American popular and military culture, was in full swing. \
The rhetoric at the time was that the USA had the right to 'act out' in some way that would involve its matchless armed forces. This was done without excessive concern about the legality or social propriety of its actions. This type of behaviour coincides with one definition of 'acting out': <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>acting out</strong>: a (usually irritating) impulsive and uncontrollable outburst by a problem child or a neurotic adult [<span>thefreedictionary</span>.com].</p> \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl233\sa230
\cf0 The USA has a powerful military, but often fails to consider how its military actions are viewed within the society of nations. This tends to encourage it to pursue armed conflicts that appear contrary to its own best interests -- even commercial or diplomatic interests. This is one aspect of US exceptionalism that many in the rest of world find disturbing: its military power appears unconnected to any sensible rationale other than the projection of its own power. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl231\sa230
\cf0 Being currently the sole super-power, the USA is frequently given a free pass to do whatever it pleases when its military is concerned. Despite being enormously expensive, the US military is seen as a guarantor of American freedoms and prosperity. However, it increasingly appears to be source of weakness for the USA in that its use tends to obscure new geopolitical realities not wholly based on military power, such as the rise of China and other <span>BRIC</span> nations. Not all problems are ones that can be solved with military force. \
\pard\pardeftab720\sa230
\cf0 As well, the US military is fiendishly expensive. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl231\sa230
\cf0 One law even more iron-clad than the efficacy of military force in inflicting pain is that if you run out of money and credit, your position in the world can diminish quickly and substantially. You do not need to spend much time reading Victorian novels to understand the indignities that lack of cash can bring. \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233\sa230
\cf0 The USA, despite being a productive and creative society, does not have unlimited cash and credit. Eventually, debts come home to roost. The US military certainly attempts to serve the interests of Western capitalism but this assumes there is sufficient cash earned elsewhere to maintain this military. If the USA spends too much money in 'saving' failed states, it may just become one itself. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl233\sa230
\cf0 As it turns out the invasion of Iraq was based completely on lies, while the invasion of Afghanistan continues to be represented as a 'just war.' This is what gives Obama some cover when he decides to escalate the Afghan war. All wars though, even the most egregious, are portrayed as just wars. It is only much later that historians untangle the lies that may have lead to that impression. \
If someone attacks you, you sometimes have the right to attack back if your attack prevents some greater evil from taking place. But the inconvenient truth about the Afghan war is that the Taliban didn't attack the USA. Al-<span>Qaeda</span> did. \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233\sa230
\cf0 The Taliban -- a particularly odious and fundamentalist regime, which most of the world considers a loathsome carbuncle on the face of the world politic -- had the temerity to lend support and provide sanctuary to Al-<span>Qaeda</span> in Afghanistan. The Taliban's guilt was one of association rather than commission. \
Clearly, Al-<span>Qaeda</span> and Taliban are separate entities. Al-<span>Qaeda</span> is a trans-national Islamic militant organization committed to the use of terrorism to forward its political goals, while the Taliban is a fundamentalist movement with a power base almost entirely within the <span>Pashtun</span> tribal areas of Afghanistan and Pakistan. The Taliban appears to lack trans-national ambitions of exporting terrorism or of influencing politics outside its core region. Al-<span>Qaeda</span> on the other hand is expert in doing just that. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl231\sa230
\cf0 Al-<span>Qaeda</span> continues to be a threat to the West, while the Taliban continues to be a threat to Western interests in Afghanistan and Pakistan as long as the West occupies Afghanistan. Clearly, you don't want to mess with the Taliban, but then you probably don't have to unless you make the mistake of invading their homeland based on justifications not quite found in international law. \
Al-<span>Qaeda</span> conspirators spent time conspiring in various places including <span style="background-color: #ffffff;">San Diego, Hamburg, and at flight schools in Florida. Fifteen of the 9/11 hijackers were from Saudi Arabia. </span>Why didn't the USA attack those places instead? Because it would have been seen as ridiculous to do so. It is usually not seen as practical or moral to attack a whole country if a tiny minority within that country has behaved badly. \
Gangs, cults and militant forces exist in most countries of the world, which if given the right opportunities could inflict serious damage to polite society. This is not just in failed states such as Somalia or the Congo, but also in places such as Idaho and southern Ontario. I bet if you travelled 100 kilometers down the road from Hamilton a group of radical bikers with a penchant for <span>meth</span>, murder and mayhem could be found. Fortunately, Canada is in no danger of being invaded by foreign forces to alleviate this security threat. \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233\sa230
\cf0 Why then were the Taliban conflated so seamlessly with Al-<span>Qaeda</span> in the popular Western imagination? One reason may have been is that they represent the perfect 'Other.' The Western public knew little about their cultural or social belief systems and tended to believe the worst. The prevailing rhetoric in the West was that the Taliban's beliefs are inimical to all Western notions of decency or civilization. This may or may not be true, but it does not constitute adequate grounds for invasion. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl233\sa230
\cf0 A basic lack of legitimacy is what makes the Afghan war so difficult to pursue and what makes it such a hard sell to American allies: it just doesn't make much sense. A fight against Al-<span>Qaeda</span> has morphed into a fight against an anti-modern but essentially nationalistic enemy in the Taliban. This is why parallels to the Vietnam war seem more and more appropriate. The Taliban has replaced the Vietcong. Apparently, not everyone within the American establishment learned the same lessons about the quagmire that was Vietnam. \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233
\cf0 In Afghanistan the smart money is staying clear of that war as best they can. If you hope to ingratiate yourself with the USA, which includes such countries as Canada, Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovakia then you might find some motivation for enthusiastically supporting this war. All others seem to have much less commitment to the idea that the West will eventually succeed there. They don't call Afghanistan the<span style="background-color: #ffffff;"> 'Graveyard of Empires'</span> for nothing.]]></content:encoded> \

\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl233\sa230
\cf0 People might think that trading in their gas-guzzler for a <span>Prius</span> would be a good way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. However, there is a simpler and less expensive way of achieving similar reductions: eating less meat and using a pressure cooker to cook legumes. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl231\sa230
\cf0 Everyone knows that driving cars is bad for the environment, as is making oil out of tar sands and generating electricity using coal. Eating beef and other livestock is bad for greenhouse gas emissions because domesticated livestock eat a lot, belch a lot and create huge clouds of methane from their manure. They also degrade the land on which they graze and pollute water systems. Rearing cattle produces more greenhouse gases than driving cars, a UN <a id="fuo_" title="report" href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=20772&amp;Cr=global&amp;Cr1=warming" target="_blank">report</a> warns. Clearly, livestock are furry versions of the obnoxious SUV. It is time that people replace their meat with something more ecologically and nutritionally responsible. \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233\sa230
\cf0 One alternative to eating large quantities of meat is to eat legumes, a food category that includes beans, peas and lentils. It is what most of the world eats and what we in the West ate before we got on the bandwagon of eating unsustainable quantities of meat protein. Legumes are classic ingredients in any <a id="eoh7" title="Diet for a Small Planet" href="http://www.amazon.com/Diet-Small-Planet-20th-Anniversary/dp/0345321200" target="_blank">Diet for a Small Planet</a>. Legumes can be bought in any middle-eastern food store for next to nothing and they are so colourful and beautiful you will want to keep them around just for decoration. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl233\sa230
\cf0 The problem with legumes is that they take a long time to cook -- they usually require overnight soaking and then must be boiled on the stove, sometimes forever. This is inconvenient for many cooks, plus they can smell up your house. Solution: use a pressure cooker to cook them. \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233
\cf0 Modern pressure cookers are completely safe, relatively inexpensive and take only a short time to learn how to use. The advantages of a pressure cooker are many: <ul> \
\pard\pardeftab720\li710\sl231
\cf0 <li>They reduce cooking time</li> \
<li>They reduce energy used during cooking</li> \
<li>They increase the convenience of cooking dried, hard-to-cook foods such as legumes</li> \
\pard\pardeftab720\fi710\sl231\sa230
\cf0 <li>They ease dramatically the preparation of stocks and broths -- essential ingredients in any good kitchen</li> </ul> I had to look all around the region to find where to buy them. I discovered that <a id="bj:3" title="Macy's" href="http://www1.macys.com/catalog/product/index.ognc?ID=96969&amp;PseudoCat=se-xx-xx-xx.esn_results" target="_blank">Macy's</a> in Buffalo -- of all places -- was the best and cheapest place for me to buy one. It may sound ridiculous but it was actually worthwhile for me to travel an hour each way and cross an international border to buy a pressure cooker set from Macy's. Since then, I have discovered a basic <span>eco</span>-truth of which Al Gore or David Suzuki would be proud: every cook (even those with no interest in vegetarianism or legume-eating) should have a modern pressure cooker. \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233\sa230
\cf0 At first people ridiculed my theory of pressure cooking, sensing that it was yet another attempt to solve through gadgetry the burdens of helping to cook food for our family. That is until they witnessed the unholy speed in which I could convert an unimpressive pot of dried ingredients into a tasty pot of steaming stew or stock. \
\pard\pardeftab720\sa230
\cf0 Note that pressure cookers are not slow-cookers. Pressure cookers use less energy while slow-cookers use more. \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233\sa230
\cf0 For those with the fear the their pressure cooker will blow up in their face you can be assured that modern pressure cookers appear to be foolproof (unless you are intent on creating an explosion). They have clever interlock mechanisms that prevent opening the pot when it is under pressure. The brand I bought was a <a id="y0ik" title="Fagor" href="http://www.fagoramerica.com/" target="_blank"><span>Fagor</span></a>, which is a Spanish company that I can highly recommend. They don't make the most expensive cookers but also not the cheapest. \
I would recommend stainless steel cookers over aluminium. Buying a new, modern one is preferable to resurrecting an older one. \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233
\cf0 Pressure cookers are not something you will use every meal, but I find I use it several times a week. I have been startled just how useful and basic a kitchen utensil it is.]]></content:encoded> \

Most boys love weapons. Cross-bows, battle axes, harpoons, guns: they can't get enough of them. The latest implements of war to be installed in our house are a full complement of Nerf guns. These are built like colourful assault weapons, with laser scopes, auto-loading mechanisms and support tripods. They shoot day-glo coloured Nerf bullets -- not just one a time but in a steady stream of foam-rubber mayhem. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl233\sa230
\cf0 The boys love them and find them vastly entertaining. They delight in staging long-lasting wars with both their male and female friends. Adults tend to avoid such battles in case they show something truly alarming or distasteful about the development of their children. \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233\sa230
\cf0 We didn't buy these Nerf guns for them (they were Christmas gifts from relatives) but we don't lose much sleep over the implications of them being in our house. Nor are we too concerned about the possibility they will inflict severe psychic damage on our boys. Boys will be boys. We predict these boys are as likely to be attracted to a career in video production or on the stage of musical theatre as on the battlefield. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl233\sa230
\cf0 As when training dogs, the technique that seems to work best in the boys' education is to praise the behaviour we wish to encourage and ignore that which we hope to discourage. Therefore, we tend to ignore this latest Nerf gun invasion. If we don't talk too much about it, it might just go away -- like every other toy that has crossed their path. \
What is amusing is to consider where this development in toy design -- giving boys exactly what they really want in their most-Rambo-esque fantasies -- might lead. Combining the infinite resources of the military-industrial complex with the innovative minds in toy design is ripe with possibility. \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233
\cf0 We predict: Pretend IEDs by Fisher Price -- 'trip the plate and you'll have an explosion of fun!' Guided attack drones by Lego Mindstorms -- 'your little sister will never even hear it coming!' or Fun-time Phosphorus Bombs by Play-Doh -- 'you'll bust a gut when you see the agony on your playmates' faces!']]></content:encoded> \

\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl233\sa230
\cf0 Two events over the holidays had significant positive effects on our twin boys. One was a holiday concert performance in which the boys played in the beginner violin section. The other was an impromptu violin recital the boys gave to our extended family on Christmas Eve. \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233\sa230
\cf0 [caption id="attachment_626" align="alignleft" width="225" caption="Liam and Ben during their mini-recital on Christmas Eve"]<a rel="attachment wp-att-626" href="http://michaelcumming.com/2010/01/the-subtle-rewards-of-violinpractice/pc257042-orf/"><img class="size-medium wp-image-626" title="Liam and Ben during their mini-recital on Christmas Eve" src="http://michaelcumming.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/PC257042.ORF_-225x300.jpg" alt="Liam and Ben during their mini-recital on Christmas Eve" width="225" height="300" /></a>[/caption] \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl233\sa230
\cf0 Both events were great successes and earned them an enormous number of brownie points--especially with my mother-inlaw. The boys could appreciate their new, slightly-elevated status after these performances and liked what they saw. Since then, it has become much easier to get them to practice violin. \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233\sa230
\cf0 They both started beginner violin in the Fall when they joined the admirable <a href="http://www.westhamiltonstrings.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">West Hamilton Strings</a> programme. This is a mass experiment in teaching hundreds of ordinary school kids in the public school system to play stringed instruments. Hats off to their talented and committed teacher <a href="http://www.blogger.com/profile/00811729067816388985" target="_blank">Jennifer Spleit</a>. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl231\sa230
\cf0 With these music lessons they had no idea what they had agreed to do before it too late. They didn't know that the turnstiles into violin lessons work only in one direction (for the first year at least). Their situation reminded me of ads for the Roach Motel: 'Kids can check in, but they can't check out!' \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233\sa230
\cf0 The first few orchestra practices were absolute misery for all concerned. Their revulsion at the demands of violin was total. Their conception that this little wooden instrument would take years and years of dedicated practice before they could begin to master it was completely lacking. For them, it was all too absurd to even consider. \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233
\cf0 They used the most forceful language to express their displeasure, including: <blockquote>'We signed up for violin only because we thought it would please you and we thought you would get mad if we didn't.'</blockquote> <blockquote>'We hate the violin, we hate practising it, and there is no way we will ever do this again unless you force us to.'</blockquote> Fortunately, now the situation is much easier to take. I have managed to retire the usual suspects--those authoritarian reasons that parents trot out when they want to get their kids to do something their kids see no reason to do whatsoever, including: <blockquote>'We paid the money for these lessons and we don't have money to waste on lessons you don't attend.'</blockquote> <blockquote>'Once you make a commitment for something like music lessons, you have to at least complete the first year or else we may not sign you up for anything ever again.' \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233\sa230
\cf0 'We really don't like quitters around here.'</blockquote> Or, their favourite--the full-frontal Drill Sergeant <blockquote>'You will practice your violin and you will do it NOW!'</blockquote> This authoritarian approach works remarkably poorly with our boys. Being twins growing up in a permissive family, they often gang up on their parents and freely express their derision of our parental authority. They are completely willing to live in a world where adult demands are a hazy concept that really need not concern them: <blockquote>'We don't need you because we have each other!'</blockquote> We frequently attempt to shift the balance of power over in our direction but this can be painfully ineffectual when done in the typical control-and-command manner. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl233\sa230
\cf0 The most effective approach is to plant the virus in their heads that their interests actually coincide with their parents' interests. This type of magical thinking goes something like this: <blockquote>'If you practice the violin then everyone wins!' [which in the great scheme of things is actually true] \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233\sa230
\cf0 'How many kids can read music at your age? You guys are so lucky!' \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl233\sa230
\cf0 'I heard some violins at a concert last night and I was amazed how well the musicians played! You guys would have really enjoyed it.'</blockquote> You really can't force a child to have a genuine interest in a musical instrument. You have to lead them to that goal indirectly. \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233\sa230
\cf0 In the long run you have to think up reasons why they might like to pursue this activity on their own volition. For example: because it is fun; because you can perform to admiring crowds; because it sounds really cool to hear dozen of other kids play violin at the same time; because some really cool people play violin [e.g. Ashley MacIsaac, Stephane Grappelli, and Itzhak Perlman]; because the violin is the sweetest-sounding little instrument in the world and it's been around relatively unchanged for hundred of years. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl231\sa230
\cf0 Now, especially after their performance successes, it is mostly smooth sailing for all of us. The boys practice right after school without complaint. There are no more metaphysical discussions about the legitimacy of authority in parent-child relationships, or the meaning of discipline in a decentralized, post-modern world. Leading graduate seminars with ten year olds is not all it's cracked up to be. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl233
\cf0 Now it is more about playing notes with the correct pitch, playing the score as it's written, and trying to create the sweetest tone with the bow.]]></content:encoded> <excerpt:encoded><![CDATA[You can't really force a child to have a genuine interest in a musical \

This is one of my favourite photos of Hamilton. I forget exactly where it was taken but I believe it was near Wentworth and Burlington Streets. It was taken on 19 July 2008. \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233\sa230
\cf0 It shows two dogs who are getting some fresh air and exercise on the roof of a front porch to a modest town-house, in a poor neighbourhood of Hamilton. \
They apparently got onto the roof through a small sliding window directly above the porch roof. \
This photo raises some interesting questions: \
<em>Did the dogs go out the window on their own or were they encouraged to so by someone?</em> \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl231\sa230
\cf0 <em>One possible scenario: the dogs were sent out there because they needed 'to get out' and the window was the most convenient exit. Is this what happened?</em> \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233\sa230
\cf0 <em>Are the dogs in any danger of falling?</em> \
<em>Do the dogs enjoy being on the roof?</em> \
<em>Do the dogs urinate and defecate on the roof?</em> \
<em>What do the dogs think of someone taking their picture?</em> \
<em>Is having dogs on the roof a common occurrence or did I just happen by the only time it occurred?</em> \
<em>Are there people in the room behind and what are they doing?</em> \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl231
\cf0 <em>Is this a display of some kind of civic or personal dysfunction or is there something else going on? </em>]]></content:encoded> <excerpt:encoded><![CDATA[Two dogs get some fresh air and exercise on the roof of a front porch to a \

\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl231\sa230
\cf0 Two days ago, on a whim, I took my first visit to downtown Brantford, Ontario. I wanted to walk around, take some <a href="http://picasaweb.google.ca/michaeljcumming/ColborneStDemolitionArea?feat=directlink" target="_blank">photographs</a> and get a feel for the place. South-western Ontario tends to reward such impromptu exploration. \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233\sa230
\cf0 <span>I drove to the densest part of old downtown Brantford, the place where the buildings are closest together and the streets the narrowest. This I usually find to be the most interesting and historic part of any town. There in Brantford, I found to my horror that a large chuck of the historic core was under threat of imminent demolition! </span><span>Workers were preparing to dismantle one of the most interesting and historic street scapes in town. The hammer-swinging may have already begun. </span> \
<span>After doing a few Google searches once I got home, the full reality of the situation dawned on me: I happened to stumble upon what might be one the most flagrant instances of urban vandalism in the province. I confidently categorize it as vandalism because it doesn't appear, from what I have read, to make any sense whatsoever. </span>They are taking down something of great value and replacing it with nothing at all. \
<span>This is not the demolition of a single building that has fallen into disrepair, or an urban redevelopment proposal that lacks architectural style. No, this is far worse. This is the wanton destruction of an entire downtown street scape, parts of which date from Victorian times. <span><span><span><span><span>The site appears to be dripping in urban and historical significance.</span> </span></span></span>It literally anchors one corner of the historical district of Brantford. </span>Its buildings, street scape and composition speak deeply of a social history that stretches back to the founding of the city of Brantford.</span> \
It is a puzzling situation to see something of such great apparent value about to be eliminated. <h2>What is there</h2> <span>The block to be demolished is located in the central historical core of </span>Brantford<span>, along the south side of </span>Colborne<span> St. It is a long block that includes, apparently, 41 separate buildings, some of which date from the mid to late 19th century. </span>Colborne<span> St lies on top of a small bluff rising above the meandering Grand River.</span> \
Buildings on the south side of Colborne<span> St are built with sub-structures that go down several stories. Elaborate steel and masonry structures prevent the buildings from tumbling down the bluff.</span> <span><span>These buildings are a bit run-down at this point but are definitely picturesque. </span>The age of the buildings vary and the overall design of the block was incremental and unplanned. This is what gives it its charm.</span> \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233
\cf0 [caption id="attachment_799" align="alignnone" width="320" caption="Building on stilts, to be demolished, Colborne St, Brantford, ON"]<a rel="attachment wp-att-799" href="http://michaelcumming.com/2010/02/urban-destruction-in-the-heartof-brantford-ontario/p2167294/"><img class="size-full wp-image-799 " title="Building on stilts, to be demolished, \

\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl231\sa230
\cf0 It reminds me of several hill or ridge towns I have seen in Europe or North America where a neat row of attached buildings presents a unified elevation up above on the street, but tumbles down a slope on the other side. This usually creates interesting town scapes that old-style landscape painters might find attractive. \

\cf0 Below Colborne<span> St are streets called Water and </span>Wharfe<span>. <span>Streets with such names</span><span> tend to be at the central historical core of cities -- typically located along original shorelines.</span> This suggests that not so long ago, </span>along these streets in Brantford, <span>there were warehouses and small port operations connected to the nearby Grand River. </span> \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233\sa230
\cf0 Brantford<span> itself is a small city, currently not especially prosperous, known for its associations with Alexander Graham Bell's invention of the telephone and as the hometown of hockey's 'The Great One' -Wayne Gretzky. It is also close to major settlements of First Nations peoples at the nearby Six Nations reserve and has an attractive location on the biodiverse Grand River. </span> \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl231\sa230
\cf0 Brantford<span> has a small downtown. There are some beautiful buildings in the downtown core</span><span>. From an architectural and urban design perspective there is much of interest in Brantford, including, fine churches, law courts, civic buildings and a modernist City Hall. <span>Brantford</span> has a central square in the form of an Union Jack around which some of its most prominent buildings are grouped.</span> Outside of Brantford's historic core is a variety of low density suburban housing and big-box retailing typical for this part of Ontario. \

\cf0 Brantford<span>, despite recent pain due to de-industrialization in the manufacturing sector, is clearly a city with some agreeable cultural, historical and natural assets. These could be spun into something quite attractive.</span> Clearly, demolishing a prominent street scape in the heart of downtown works against such a goal. <h2>My take on this situation</h2> <span>I think demolition <span>of this street scape</span> is a terrible idea. It should have been preserved for the following reasons:</span> <h3>As a mixed-use place to live and work</h3> <span><span>One of the best ways of creating vitality in downtown cores is to create mixed-use developments that enable people of various incomes to work and live in close proximity. The block being destroyed is an historic and extremely charming example of this type of development. </span>On Colborne St<span> it enabled people to live over pet shops, diners and clothing stores. This is exactly why people sometimes travel to the 'Old World' -- to see charming scenes of ordinary people living over places like pet shops! Clearly, Brantford is working according to a different model of perceived value.</span></span> \

\cf0 The condemned block once housed people, was a place to work and was likely an interesting place to shop. All these people associated with the area will now have to live, work and shop elsewhere. The city of Brantford is in effect telling these people to get lost. This 'communication strategy' seems harsh, anti-democratic and completely counter-productive to the economic and cultural development of a distressed community. It makes no sense. \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233\sa230
\cf0 <h3>Overall attractiveness and urban integrity</h3> <span>The block provides Brantford with urban integrity and texture. The block blends in perfectly with surrounding buildings and anchors the downtown both visually and architecturally on the edge of a bluff.</span><span> The individual buildings are attractive. The </span>street scape<span> in which they are housed is also attractive. <span>The buildings are currently run-down but this only indicates a lack of investment in their upkeep rather than any inherent lack of value in the buildings themselves.</span></span> \
This condemned block -- due both to the quality of its individual buildings as well that of its overall assembly -- is probably near the top in terms of overall civic quality and interest for threatened urban street scapes in Ontario. Brantford definitely cannot afford to lose an architectural and historical assembly of such quality. <h3>As a conduit for history</h3> [caption id="attachment_801" align="alignnone" width="320" caption="Mixed-use Victorian housing and commercial block, to be demolished, Brantford, ON"]<a rel="attachment wp-att-801" href="http://michaelcumming.com/2010/02/urban-destruction-in-the-heart-of-brantford-ontario/p2167299/"><img class="size-full wp-image-801 " title="Mixed-use Victorian housing and commercial block, to be demolished, Brantford, ON" src="http://michaelcumming.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/P2167299.jpg" alt="Mixed-use Victorian housing and commercial block, to be demolished, Brantford, ON" width="320" height="240" /></a>[/caption] \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl231\sa230
\cf0 It takes a certain insensitivity to tear down buildings that have withstood the trials and tribulations of the last century and a half. Each age produces its own sets of buildings. These buildings will not come back. Once they are gone they are gone. \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233\sa230
\cf0 This is not to say that all old buildings should be saved. But it does mean that ones of noteworthy quality at the centre of the historical core of cities should be given special consideration and protection. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl233\sa230
\cf0 This is also not to say that cities can't build modern buildings. Preservation of historic buildings does not put modern architects out of work. The combination of the qualities of old buildings with modern design is often a winning combination. \
However, demolishing old buildings in some absurd, nihilistic notion of 'modernity' makes no sense. <h2>What <em>were</em> they thinking? Some theories</h2> The question is for me was not whether it is a good idea to get rid of this street scape -- it is one of those situations where the inappropriateness of the demolition is not in question even for a nanosecond. I can conceive of no world in which the demolition of these buildings would make any sense. \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233\sa230
\cf0 The question then becomes 'What <em>were</em> they thinking?' \
<span>The decision to demolish the south side of Colborne St was not made in a vacuum. It was made by upstanding citizens of Brantford, likely with support from parts of their community. Here are some theories of what might have factored in their decision-making process:</span> <h3>Elimination of decay and devaluation of the old</h3> <span>Old, historic buildings -- especially ones that that are attached to one another in an urban block that falls down a little bluff, are expensive and troublesome to maintain. As well, some people simply don't seem to like old buildings. They associate them with bad conditions, bad lifestyles, bad choices and all around moral decrepitude. </span> \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl231\sa230
\cf0 <span>Clearly, in Brantford, old attached buildings as on Colborne St are associated with the underclass -- those who are seen not to have the sense or the resources to live in a more mainstream suburban setting. </span> <h3>Elimination of venues for marginalized businesses and residents</h3> <span>When you demolish an old, sketchy part of town, you usually displace marginalized businesses (e.g. tattoo parlours, head shops, crack dens) and marginalized residents (e.g. prostitutes, drug addicts and those on welfare). Getting rid of a venue for such things lets people imagine that they don't exist.</span> \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233
\cf0 Whenever an urban block is threatened with demolition there is also a natural process of marginalization. Who wants to put money into a part of the city that people in power want to eliminate? The threat of elimination is the opposite of a vote of confidence. City Hall thinks so little of residents' homes and lives that they are willing to go to the expense of sweeping them away for a simple, but seriously deranged idea -- an idea based on the concept of 'eliminationism.' This eliminationism applies equally to the architectural and social context of Colborne St. Eliminate 'bad' buildings and the 'bad' people will also \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233\sa230
\cf0 magically disappear. <span>It is a fearsomely destructive idea. </span> <h3>Collapse of multiple owners into simpler entities</h3> <span>When you have a street scape with 41 individual buildings, you may have 41 separate owners</span><span>. If all the properties are bought or expropriated then 41 owners can magically collapse into one easier-to-administer entity. <span>Making it single ownership makes it more similar to the suburban areas of </span>Brantford<span> where the lots are large and the ownership patterns uncomplicated.</span></span> \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl233\sa230
\cf0 The Colborne<span> St block is the opposite of the suburbs: it consists of a messy warren of interlocking spaces and relationships. Getting rid of this simplifies things for some people but at the cost of overall vitality for the city.</span> \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233\sa230
\cf0 Getting rid of this block of old buildings is like clear-cutting an old-growth forest. In both cases you replace diversity with a less stable and less valuable mono-culture. This destruction makes no sense and goes against all we now know about how to develop and revitalize cities. <h3>Provision for higher-returning developments</h3> <span>Sometimes old buildings are demolished to be replaced by higher net-revenue developments. This explains why parts of Toronto have high-rises vs. lower-density row buildings, which were once common throughout its core. But the goal in Brantford does not appear to be a search for <span>higher-returning, higher-density development</span></span><span>. There </span>doesn<span>'t appear to be any preferred future use for the site, except as the site of a bizarre culture war. </span>Previously, <span>the site had assured income. No firm plans have been presented to replace this income. Something was traded for nothing.</span> <h2>Conclusion</h2> <span><span> Usually when I travel around small town Ontario I am impressed by the quality of architecture and the overall charm of settlement. This was even the case in Brantford for me before I saw the ominous blue demolition fences surrounding an area of prime architectural significance.</span></span> \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl233\sa230
\cf0 The decision by the City of Brantford to demolish a good chunk of their historical core is indeed unusual. <span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>The buildings to be demolished are quite interesting and their site appears to be absolutely central to the history of the city.</span></span></span></span></span> Like many such crimes against heritage and common sense it was not committed by outside forces intent on the destruction of </span>Brantford<span>, but appears to be a curiously home-grown affair.</span></span></span></span> \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl233
\cf0 This decision <span><span><span>to demolish buildings along Colborne St</span></span></span> takes a marginalized city and further marginalizes it. <span><span><span>It is such a complete reversal of things I value that I remain stunned and saddened. </span></span></span>]]></content:encoded> \

\pard\pardeftab720\sl233
\cf0 go back every year to visit family.  Some of the older downtown buildings have been replaced and a big part of that decision was because of the university satellite campus that took up residence downtown.  a lot of the old buildings are still there and still doing the same things they always have been.  There are some sad stories about cool places downtown that aren't there anymore, Ludwigs (men's clothing store that lived downtown for more than 40 years moved to the north end) Heinbucks (basically a junk shop, four floors of just...stuff, extreme fire trap but very interesting never the less)  there is still a tattoo parlor downtown, I got my first tat there.  it's called Kreative Khaos and has been an unstanding Brantford landmark for as long as I can remember.  Brantford's steady urban decline began long before now though, it actually started when Massey Ferguson closed it's door effectively making hundreds of people unemployed.  The changed to downtown are vital even though it does mean losing really cool buildings...and I am speaking as someone who did live downtown in a turn of the century house split into apartments.  I also have many friends who lived in apartments over condemmed stores.  Anyway, that's all I wanted to say about something that's close to my heart.  Brantford is a neat town and unfortunately it's history and beauty are only going to continue being destroyed in the name of progress.  As a fellow UE it makes me sad so see buildings that I explored back in highschool when I was first getting into this cease to be.]]></wp:comment_content> \

Why would we keep these buildings, \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233\sa230
\cf0 when they are just rapidly decaying and rat infested? I understand the histroical signifcance, but if we wanted to perserve the buildings that badly, why were they not 'kept up' (for lack of a better term) throughout the years.  It is unfortunate that we are losing SOME historical presence throughout the downtown, however, nothing lasts forever and it's time for a change.  Additionally, not all historical builds are lost. Both Wilfrid Laurier Univeristy and Mokhawk College have embarced the historical buildings by fixing them and using them for lectures, community use and the like.  So, to say that we are completely destorying the downtowns hisotrical 'feel' is unrealistic. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl233\sa230
\cf0 Additionally, Brantford has the opportunity to become prosperous, just as it once was.  Since the arrival of the Univeristy and College downtown, the population is growing thus allowing current businesses to prosper and new businesses to emerge. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl233
\cf0 Given the changes throughout downtown, I believe that over the next decade Downtown Brantford will become a hotspot for community events, shows (at the Sanderson Center), better nightlife, etc. that will allow for the population retention as well as prospering businesses.  Thus, it is my hope that this will result in a healthy economy for the city of Brantford as a whole.]]></wp:comment_content> \

\cf0 You write "nothing lasts forever and it\'92s time for a change."

\cf0 When a city doesn't protect what appears to this outsider to be its 'crown jewels' (despite how rat-infested they appear to be) it suggests a city pursuing a self-destructive, ill-informed path.

Downtown Brantford - having worked in the core \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233
\cf0 in the early 1990's, I was witness to the decay then.  The "stilt" homes are similar to the one's in downtown St. Catharines which is also experiencing the demise of its' downtown core - once a great source of shopping and eateries  it now boasts empty storefronts.  I too am appalled by the decisions of the cities and towns to simply eradicate historical gems for the sake of progress - or let's just call a spade a spade - monies placed into the hands of developers who operate on the basis of greed and have no intention of preserving that which is part of Canada and indeed Ontario's history!]]></wp:comment_content> \

And demolish it he did, despite  earlier agreements to at least preserve its facade. The art-deco structure was reduced to rubble with city hall approval. Decades of mis-management allowed this to happen, much the same way it's happening elsewhere. Since the Seville was levelled, several other old structures have met the same fate.

\pard\pardeftab720\sl233
\cf0 through the downtown area hundreds of times, I find that the demolition of these buildings was both a relief and a shame. The downtown in our city was once very beautiful and still is one of my favourite parts to visit - the shops and old houses still in the nearby streets are absokutely gorgeous and show workmanship and individualism practically nonexistant in the newer subdivisions. During the early 1900's, the area served as the heart of the city, with a bustling industrial sector, many factories and a railroad. The houses were such prime real estate that they were squished together to look more like a city in Europe than Canada's usually more widely spaced houses. Now, the railroad go into another portion of the town. The houses are dirty and falling into disrepair; some of the most beautiful houses, homes to the wealthy, with beautiful Victorian and French Chateau architecture have become dirty and have fallen into disrepair. They, especially the houses in the area to be demolished, looked so grimy that when the Post-Apocalyptic neighbourhood scenes were shot there, the director actually cleaned up the streets a bit before shooting. The donwntown and those buildings in particular were almost a sign of how far we have fallen - Brantford now has one of the highest unemployment rates in the area - and were not pleasant to look at anymore besides. Additionally, the city has been trying to revitalise the downtown area by putting in the new Harmony Square and other attractions for  a younger crowd in the hopes of attracting a campus of Wilfrid Laurier University. We currently have an outpost of sorts of the school downtown, but they hope to attract a permanent Campus. \
One of the main buildings housing students surrounds Harmony Square on 2 sides. On the other side and across the street areolder townhouses that were much better maintained. On this side were the dingier, less attractive townhouses, many with "For Lease" signs in the window. The view looked like a comedic contrast - the new Harmony Square and the old, sad buildings behind. Most of the buildings were not even making money - the core has a bad rep, and in a sprawling city like Brantford, living in the core has little to no advantages. Many of the businesses are also driven away by this bad rep. The new view, post-deconstruction, is much more attractive. The hill provides a sweeping view of the open sky from Harmony Square and on the hill itself the Grand is visible. City workers have been planting trees along the sidewalk and placing gorgeous wrought-iron benches. This is much improved over the graffiti'd storefronts, many having not changed in the slightest from the seventies or fifties, having been blocked off in those years. I think that overall it was the only option available to us. Brantford does not have the public support necessary to revitalise the downtown area as proposed; it's ugly now and thats all people can see it as. However, if the city shows what a little work could do to make it better, than perhaps interest will revive in the core - I can honestly say that this was the first time the public took interest in these buildings since "Silent Hill" was shot here.]]></wp:comment_content> \

\pard\pardeftab720\sl233\sa230
\cf0 One of my favourite times of years is the Doors Open season. This season starts in the early spring and ends in late fall. One of the great rewards of spring is for Doors Open events to begin. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl233\sa230
\cf0 When this event occurs in Hamilton, I am giddy with excitement as I plot my route--to see how many sites I can cram into each day. I have created online <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps/ms? ie=UTF8&amp;hl=en&amp;msa=0&amp;msid=100877706648440612680.0004840b0be7866656d76&amp;z=11" target="_blank">maps</a> in order to better organize my assault of cultural consumption--and to help others do the same. \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233\sa230
\cf0 I have learned that almost every single site is worth visiting The architectural, cultural and community resources of this city, and surrounding communities, are remarkable. For example, lining Barton Street, Hamilton are an impressive number of large churches, built at a time when Barton was a major commercial thoroughfare. Eventually, I hope to visit every one. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl233\sa230
\cf0 You don't have to be an architect to appreciate such sites; they are often captivating for all who walk in the door. Usually, there are well-informed guides to help you see and appreciate the social and architectural history that infuses these places. It's like an 'embarrassment of riches' scenario; incredible riches but few crowds. You sometimes feel very privileged to participate. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl231\sa230
\cf0 Doors Open events tend to be social. They connect you with people who care deeply about buildings and are active in these buildings' attached communities. A building without a community is often not that interesting. What makes them really come alive are the dozens of people who are passionate about preserving, inhabiting or simply telling about them to strangers.  It's like you stumble into a compelling interactive museum, guided by experts in the field, all for free. I must confess I really like the 'for free' part. \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233\sa230
\cf0 The above is all well and good, however, one problem with such cultural consumption is that in my case it is a high-carbon pastime. I drive to these places in a car because the sites tend to be far-flung and because I want to visit as many as I possibly can. So, for me there is a bit of cognitive dissonance. Knowing what lurks inside of heritage buildings (usually splendid places and dedicated, kindly people) clashes with my desire to moderate my consumption and keep our embarrassingly-large car parked in the driveway. The building preservationist side of me wants to work better with the treehugger side, because both should be working on the same team. \
Getting around to Door Open sites appears to be the only environmentally-suspect aspect of these events. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl233\sa230
\cf0 I could concentrate on one geographical area but then I would miss out on some out-of-the-way gems. I really do want to see it all. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl231\sa230
\cf0 It's this fear of 'missing out' I suppose is one problem. I want to see all the sites, but perhaps I don't need to see them all at once. Slow-eating is clearly a good idea (as we often tell our ravenous twins). Perhaps slow-Doors-Open-touring is as well. Buildings that may have taken hundreds of years to acquire their 'patina' may require more than a rushed afternoon to fully appreciate. \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233
\cf0 Other ways of being more environmentally responsible would be to use public transit, which is often possible, or to use an \
\pard\pardeftab720\sa230
\cf0 alternate means of personal transportation such as a bicycle. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl233\sa230
\cf0 I think, though what might prove most sustainable is to do the touring with other people so that a larger group could pool their carbon consumption. This is similar to the <a href="http://thepearlcompany.ca/?page_id=4" target="_blank">Art Bus</a> concept--a highly successful Hamilton enterprise that encourages communal gallery touring during Hamilton's monthly Art Crawl. I'm sure a similar idea could be applied to Doors Open touring, where the attractions are similarly dispersed and the rewards of participation are equally as great. \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233
\cf0 Doors Open events are all about community. This community focus should also apply to how people get to far-flung sites. A communal approach to transportation would make Doors Open touring more environmentally-friendly and more fun as well.]]></content:encoded> \

\cf0 Your comment, Michael, about visiting all the churches in a certain location is interesting. I can remember living in England and doing just that with the local churches. Each one had its own particular aspect that was unusual:  one church had a grove of lime trees leading to the main door, another had a huge thousand-year-old yew growing beside it.  Another church seemed to have a large floor space when I wandered around inside. Yet when I circled the building  from the outside, the church seemed somehow much smaller. \

\pard\pardeftab720\sl233\sa230
\cf0 [caption id="attachment_907" align="alignnone" width="320" caption="Cooling pond and Entrance screen at the Linamar Corporation"]<a rel="attachment wp-att-907" href="http://michaelcumming.com/2010/05/machine-shop-paradise-inguelph/p4248001/"><img class="size-full wp-image-907 " title="Cooling pond and Entrance screen at the Linamar Corporation" src="http://michaelcumming.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/P4248001.jpg" alt="Cooling pond and Entrance screen at the Linamar Corporation" width="320" height="240" /></a>[/caption]</h2> <h2>Introduction</h2> As part of Doors Open 2010, Guelph channelled its  inner Stuttgart with tours at the <a id="hlli" title="Linamar Corporation" href="http://linamar.com/default.aspx">Linamar Corporation</a>. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl233\sa230
\cf0 The  Linamar Corp makes precision  machine parts for various manufacturing sectors, including the  automotive industry. Judging by the tour it appears to be a successful,  high-growth multinational corporation, with operations in Canada, US,  Mexico, Europe and Asia. \
It all started in Guelph, when a young  Hungarian immigrant named Frank Hasenfratz set up a one-man machine shop  in the basement of his home in 1964. Lucky for Guelph, he found the  city to be a supportive environment for what later became an industrial  empire. This appears to be a classic tale of a highly-skilled immigrant  with ambition and marketable skills doing very well indeed in the New World. \
At the entrance to Linamar there  is a decorative screen with air-foil shaped blades. These expensive  building components create the impression that something highly  technical, perhaps aesthetically-inspired is going on inside. Linamar  clearly wanted to build an architectural show-piece that impresses the  local community. I would say they have succeeded in that goal. \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233\sa230
\cf0 But  the architectural aspect of this place is not what is most interesting.  Behind the impressive lobby is a large factory floor in spotless  condition. It is a high-end machine shop in the European tradition.  There are banks of Toyoda CNC machines. There are boxes full of metal  filings and gleaming parts machined from blocks of high grade steel.  There are signs showing how things should be done. Obviously, process  and quality control is of prime concern. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl233\sa230
\cf0 In one room they were  testing parts for the McLaren Group, the famous UK race car builders.  Not knowing too much about the parts manufacturing business, I would say  that working with McLaren is something to brag about. \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233\sa230
\cf0 The whole  place has that unmistakable whiff of success. I remarked to my sons,  who were reluctantly along on the tour, 'You know guys training as  machinists or CNC designer/programmers might not be such a bad career  path.' <h2>Blue-collar knowledge work</h2> At Linamar,  relatively small number of people perform highly skilled work. The  workers seem to enjoy their work, tending to the CNC milling machines,  making and testing metal prototypes. It is clear the instant you walk in  the door that this would be desirable employment for many people. There  is a sense that people working here have an enviable degree of autonomy. \
This is what could be called blue-collar knowledge  work. \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233
\cf0 Canada is not known for blue-collar knowledge work,  despite Southern Ontario (and the metropolitan area of Montreal) being  the industrial heartlands of the country. We seem much more content with  the basic extractive and resource-based industries like mining,  forestry, fishing and farming. This has made the country rich, but it  means Canada often lacks the skills to produce innovative new products  and also makes it vulnerable to the vagaries of basic commodity pricing.  The has \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233\sa230
\cf0 been true since the foundation of the country. \
Southern  Ontario has a substantial auto sector, but most of the main action in  this industry such as design and development is done elsewhere in  California, Germany or Korea. For those interested in industrial design,  this puts Canada on the periphery. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl233\sa230
\cf0 Counties such as Germany,  Japan, the Netherlands and Switzerland have much stronger craft  traditions than do Canada. These lend support to blue-collar knowledge  economies through extensive apprenticeship programs and government support for precision manufacturing. \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233\sa230
\cf0 In Canada, there is not the  sense that machine-dependent trades, ones that people typically go to  vocational school to learn, are the preferred ways of making a living.  Knowledge-based industries such as software or telecommunications get  much more attention. High-end machine shops like you find at Linamar  get much less attention. \
In Canada, the dominant and sometimes naive  idea is that the only really desirable jobs are white-collar ones. <h2>Mittelstand in Canada</h2> Linamar  appears to have its roots in a type of company that in Germany would be  part of the <em>Mittelstand</em>,  that is, small to medium-sized, family-owned businesses. \
In  Germany in the 1960's the explosive post-war period of economic growth  called the <em>Wirtschaftswunder</em> was largely a triumph of the Mittelstand. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl233\sa230
\cf0 In German-speaking countries, Mittelstand-type firms have become experts at  producing well-designed, highly technical products. Such small, but  sometimes extraordinary capable companies have created much of the  industrial wealth that provides such high living standards in Germany,  Austria and Switzerland. \
Linamar has  obviously grown way past the boundaries of the Mittelstand and has become a North American style multinational, but its Mittelstand  roots seem clear. \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233\sa230
\cf0 In Canada, an anonymous corporate model is  more common, where the allegiances to a skilled workforce or to craft  ideals are much less focused. With large corporations the quality of the  end product depends more on trans-national economic factors and tends  to have little relation to family pride. <h2>Conclusion</h2> At Linamar,  it is obvious that Frank Hasenfratz and his family are the  original motivating force behind this corporation -or at least, this  is how it is presented. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl231\sa230
\cf0 It appears that Frank Hasenfratz brought his  machine shop ethos with him when he immigrated to Canada. Without him and his family, there would likely be nothing similar to Linamar  on the outskirts of Guelph. \
You find this pattern often in Canada. Here  we tend to import our expertise rather than develop it in-house. It is  unclear whether this is a sustainable industrial development strategy. \
For  an industrial culture to produce machined objects of high quality, as  at Linamar, you have to hold the  work of machinists in high regard. In this sense Linamar is  both a product-focused workplace, where beautiful gleaming parts are staked neatly in boxes, as well as a worker-focused one where each  worker is encouraged to take great pride in their work. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl231
\cf0 For  these reasons a visit to Linamar is refreshing.  Unfortunately, it seems like a bit of an anomaly in the current Canadian  industrial context.]]></content:encoded> \

\pard\pardeftab720\sl233\sa230
\cf0 A surprising event happened recently in Hamilton, The <a id="dkf-" title="Pearl Company" href="http://thepearlcompany.ca/">Pearl Company</a> announced it was shutting down. The Pearl Company is a cultural enterprise owned and operated by Barbara Milne and Gary Santucci in the Landsdale  neighbourhood of Hamilton. The reasons given for their decision to pull  out was that they were no longer willing to fight City Hall in a  long-running zoning dispute, which apparently has cost them a lot of  money over the years. \
The Pearl Company has been instrumental in  bringing cultural events to one of the most distressed neighbourhoods of Hamilton. It is well known locally for putting on an almost absurdly  large number of musical, theatrical and artistic performances in their  converted industrial space. They also operate the successful Art Bus,  which conducts tours of Hamilton's art galleries twice a month. By all  accounts, and from personal experience, their cultural contribution to  the city is of the first order. They are the energizer bunnies of  cultural entrepreneurship within the city. In any sensible regime they  would be made heroes of urban renewal or be given the keys to the city.  But not here. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl233\sa230
\cf0 There has been some discussion about the  procedures involved in zoning applications and whether these procedures  were followed, but the bottom line is that the good The Pearl Company is  doing is readily apparent while the bad they might be doing is not  apparent at all. \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233\sa230
\cf0 Development resulting from cultural initiatives such as the James St North <a id="moju" title="Art Crawl" href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=5920392694">Art Crawl</a> gets a lot of press in Hamilton. But running The Pearl Company out of  town seems not only to be a bad idea, it seems like a crazy idea. What  would be 'no-brainers'  in other places [e.g. supporting venues like The Pearl Company] are  controversial here. Could this be another example of Hamilton shooting  itself in the foot? Has Hamilton completed its transition from the  'Ambitious City' to one in which no good deed goes unpunished? Many  people seem to think <a id="fspa" title="so" href="http://www.raisethehammer.org/article/1177/pearl_company_owners_giving_up">so</a>. <h3>Polarization</h3> What  newcomers to Hamilton quickly learn is that how they view the city may  be diametrically opposed to how many long term residents view the city.  We see the same place but may come away with sharply differing  conclusions. This disparity of perspective is typical of polarized  social, economic and political environments, which I suppose is what we  have here in Hamilton. In some respects it is like a northern industrial  version of the Deep South. Some benefit from the status quo while others do not. \
The  epicentre of polarized viewpoints is in the Lower Town of Hamilton and  most particularly in its East End near King and Steven -- exactly where The Pearl Company bravely set up shop. This is Hamilton's Downtown Eastside. Poor people tend to live in this part of town, rich people elsewhere, and never the twain shall meet. <h3>Micro-managing investment</h3> You  would think that a poverty-stricken city like Hamilton would try to  encourage as much private investment as possible in this age of  declining public coffers. Yet, City Hall appears to chase away people  with real money to invest - with a stick. This city is not always open  for business. \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233
\cf0 City Hall in its planning policies seems to have a  preference about where private money ought to be spent. It has a desire \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233\sa230
\cf0 to funnel investment into officially-sanctioned areas such as James St  North, Locke and Ottawa Streets. These are attractive areas, with great  potential to be sure, but what about the rest of the city?  Neighbourhoods such as Landsdale  are ignored and marginalized even though physically and architecturally  there is not much difference between it and its more fashionable  cousins. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl231\sa230
\cf0 Surely the city should focus on the fact that money is  being invested rather than on where it is being invested. Trying to  micro-manage private investment decisions through the planning and  building departments seems absurd. \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233\sa230
\cf0 The power structures of some  cities work against artists while some work against business people. In  Hamilton they manage to work against both these camps. Those on both the  left and the right wings of the political spectrum can experience the  neglect of City Hall! <h3>Marginalization of neighbourhoods</h3> Hamilton, partly due to its archaic planning and zoning systems, intentionally concentrates poverty in areas such as Landsdale.  Despite this concentration of poverty one can easily see the attraction  of opening an arts and performance space in the middle of it. This is  what normally happens in cities lucky enough to have entrepreneurs like  the Pearl Company's owners: investment takes place in distressed  neighbourhoods since costs there are low. Fighting City Hall year on end  obviously adds to investors' costs. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl233\sa230
\cf0 In the US, neighbourhood  marginalization and red-lining often has a racial component. But not so  much in Hamilton -ethnic minorities can be found in most parts of the  city. Here, marginalization is more poverty and environmentally based,  with poor people coming in all colours. \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233\sa230
\cf0 Another important factor  in the marginalization of neighbourhoods is environmental degradation.  As in many cities, especially those with heavy industry, the East End is  poorer than the west due to prevailing winds and the particulates they  carry. Anything near or downwind of a steel plant is bound to suffer  some marginalization. But this does not explain The Pearl Company's case  since areas further east of it that are much closer to the belching  furnaces (e.g. Ottawa St) are on the upswing. <h3>Architectural resources</h3> One  of Hamilton's greatest resources is the huge number of old brick  warehouse buildings that dot Lower Town and elsewhere. The Pearl Company  is an excellent example of adaptive reuse for this type of building. It  is surprising how few of these industrial buildings are converted into  productive uses as you might see in larger centres. This huge resource  exists here but is not being exploited. Indeed, City Hall appears to  actively discourage its exploitation. This is puzzling. <h3>Conclusion</h3> There  is a battle of ideas going on here but it's difficult to sort out  exactly what kind of ideas are in play. The politics are certainly  parochial, the processes of neighbourhood marginalization are severe and  the planning policies appear to be self-defeating. However, I can't  quite understand this situation. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl231\sa230
\cf0 What The Pearl Company  episode does suggest is that private investment in unfashionable areas  of Hamilton is extremely risky even though some of these areas appear to  be full of economic potential. \

\cf0 This can't be good.]]></content:encoded> \

\pard\pardeftab720\fi1417\sl233\sa230
\cf0 <content:encoded><![CDATA[The other day I was reading a software book called <a id="in06" title="The RSpec Book" href="http://www.pragprog.com/titles/achbd/the-rspec-book">The RSpec Book</a> [Behaviour Driven Development with Rspec, Cucumber, and Friends, by  David Chelimsky]. It deals with the specification and automated testing  of software. This might sound as dry as dust to those lacking a geeky  inner-core, but actually it raises interesting issues about design  processes and requirements engineering. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl231\sa230
\cf0 In  design, defining what is required is a complex task. What design  requirements are and whether they have been fulfilled is one of the more  central issues in design. \
In large projects, a large book of  requirements is often compiled at the beginning of the design process.  This documentation is often brimming with interesting ideas and  insights, much like a Victorian novel. However, the problem is that this  impressive pile of documentation is usually not referred to as often as  it should be later in the design process. The greater the length of  this documentation, the harder it is to use. It is extremely easy to  forget what you know. \
Wouldn't it be nice if all the content in  the entire requirements documentation is executable so you can never  miss that important nugget of wisdom buried deep inside? \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233\sa230
\cf0 By  executable what I mean is that you can send a command to RSpec: 'Check  all of the specifications now, and report back whether they all still  pass.' If they pass, then they are coloured green, if not, red. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl233\sa230
\cf0 RSpec derives from an innovative approach to software engineering called <a id="zflu" title="Extreme Programming" href="http://www.extremeprogramming.org/">Extreme Programming</a> or <a id="xh2-" title="Agile design methodology" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development">Agile design methodologies</a>,  in which tests or specifications are written before the software  itself. In order to make sure you are on track, you simply run the  specifications that you have accumulated over time to see that they  pass. If they do pass, then you can rest easy, otherwise you know where  your work lies. \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233\sa230
\cf0 This, I think, is a revolutionary idea. RSpec  currently works only on software written in the programming language  Ruby but the idea could be applied to other design domains. <h2>A non-software example</h2> Recently in Hamilton Ontario the citizens were witnesses to a particularly farcical site selection process for a new stadium.  It migrated from one site to another, like a travelling minstrel show,  to land at the eleventh hour at a place which most consider not just a  compromise but a true head-scratcher. \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233
\cf0 Some of the requirements for this stadium were: \
<ul> \
\pard\pardeftab720\li710\sl231
\cf0 <li>Spend the least amount of money to accommodate an audience of a certain size</li> \
<li>Accommodate both a professional football team as well as an amateur summer games</li> \
<li>Improve the urban quality of the city core</li> \
<li>Make it possible for people to get to the stadium using both public transit as well as private cars</li> \
\pard\pardeftab720\fi710\sl231
\cf0 <li>Make the venue visible so that people travelling past the city are made aware of the stadium</li> </ul> Most of these requirements are typical of such sports stadium and are non-controversial. Surely it wouldn't be that difficult to manage these requirements? However, no: the final site decided upon actually didn't satisfy some of these basic requirements. It appears that requirements tests were not run as each new site was introduced. If RSpec could have been run, it would still be glowing bright red. \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233\sa230
\cf0 Adequate  requirements documentation was almost certainly produced at the  beginning of this project, but wasn't referred to later, or was ignored.  This politicization of design requirements is not that uncommon, but it  is a setup for the depressing waste of civic resources. This, in a  community that can ill afford such waste. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl233

\cf0 <content:encoded><![CDATA[A  fundamental issue in design is that designers must interact with  clients in formulating design requirements. It is difficult to come up  with a means of expressing design requirements that is both  comprehensive, capable of expressing creative ideas and aspirations, and  is of use during the entire design and implementation process. This  knowledge representation must enable and encourage participation from a  diverse community of stakeholders, all with different concerns,  expertise and frames of reference. Successful design projects are ones  in which diverse concerns are integrated at an early stage. \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233\sa230
\cf0 It  is also important that design requirements are testable throughout the  design process, such that the following questions are managed: \'91Are we  designing the things that we started out designing?\'91 and \'91Is what we are  designing fulfilling the requirements that we assembled over the course  of the project?\'92 In complex design projects it is extremely easy to  \'91lose the plot.\'92 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl233\sa230
\cf0 Recently,  I discovered a software development tool called <a title="Cucumber" href="http://cukes.info/" target="_blank">Cucumber</a>, which is  scenario-based software for the computer language Ruby. Cucumber enables  you to write software specifications in a format that is quite close to  natural English and then guides you step-by-step as you implement your  software. Once parts of a scenario are satisfied, then it tells you what  feature you need to work on next. Therefore, Cucumber is a design and  specification environment, but also a work-flow generator as well a  testing framework. This combination of aspects appears to make it very  powerful. \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233\sa230
\cf0 Cucumber  encourages interactions between stakeholders, since the design  specifications can actually be read (and possibly written) by those  without technical backgrounds. This, I think, is enormously helpful. Not  only that, but these testable specifications (the holy grail for many  types of design process) stick around the entire design life-style.  Cucumber helps right at the earliest stages of a design process, where  ideas are free-flowing and ill-defined, but it also helps at the end of implementation stage where the integration of disparate parts may be  more the issue. It encourages an agile process in which design and  implementation are better integrated. You become less afraid to add new  features or design ideas late in the game because the cost of  integrating new ideas with things that work becomes manageable. \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233
\cf0 Design  is not only a technical exercise, but is also a creative one in which  stories or scenarios, which express our hopes and desires for a brighter  future, must be created, refined and managed--in a collaborative  setting. Cucumber is an exciting step towards that goal.]]></content:encoded> \

\cf0 <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="internal-source-marker_0.21149688625502128">A  long-standing interest of mine is how best to encourage real creativity  in design. One way is to write design scenarios, which express that which we hope to see designed. If this process were to be open so that a  diverse group of stakeholders could participate, then the quality of  the design process and the resulting design product should improve.</p> An excellent design and specification tool for software projects is called Cucumber, described briefly in an <a href="../2011/03/executable-design-requirements-in-cucumber/">earlier post</a>.  Cucumber is one tool in an innovative approach to software engineering  called agile or extreme programming, in which tests are written before  the software itself. Using tests this way kills two birds with one  stone: it describes what you want in the software, as well as enables  automated testing about whether these requirements are satisfied. As you  build the requirements you construct the software that satisfies them,  all at the same time. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl231\sa230
\cf0 Software  design then becomes a cumulative exercise. Therefore, you don\'92t have to  think of all of the good ideas at once. This is expected to reduce the  cognitive load on software designers and increase their quality of life,  which are two of the basic goals of the agile programming movement.  Developer happiness tends to increase the quality of software. With the increasing role that software plays in our lives, this is not a trivial  concern. \
If  inventing software involves creating interesting scenarios, this  implies that how these scenarios are written becomes more relevant. Are  software scenarios capable of showing the stylistic and genre variations  as seen in other types of scenarios? \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233\sa230
\cf0 One  industry in which scenario writing takes a central position is the film  industry. Is storytelling in film making similar to storytelling in  software design? Are software designers a type of screenwriter? <h2>What a normal Cucumber scenario looks like</h2> Courtesy of the <a href="http://cukes.info/">Cucumber website</a>: <pre><strong>Feature</strong>: Addition <strong>In order</strong> to avoid silly mistakes <strong>As</strong> a math idiot <strong>I want</strong> to be told the sum of two numbers</pre> <pre style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Scenario</strong>: Add two numbers <strong>Given</strong> I have entered 50 into the calculator <strong>And</strong> I have entered 70 in to the calculator <strong>When</strong> I press add <strong>Then</strong> the result should be 120 on the screen</pre> This  scenario tests whether addition in a software application is performed  correctly. This might be the first step in a Cucumber-driven process. It  could lead directly into software development in Ruby, in which the  software development part -- the part that involves writing actual Ruby  code -- is not really any more difficult writing the scenarios and  features. Therefore, scenario writing not only <em>informs</em> the process but it actually <em>drives</em> the process. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl233\sa230
\cf0 As  you can see above, the way in which features and scenarios are written  in Cucumber is readily understandable by anyone who can read English.  All of the words in bold are key words in that they have special meaning  in Cucumber. Overall, it is simple and straightforward way of  expressing actions, motivations, characterizations and possibly,  narrative arcs: things that are important to the dramatic arts in  general. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl233
\cf0 Cucumber  scenarios form a good interface between those who can read or possibly  write them (most of the population) and those who write computer code (a  small minority). \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl233\sa230
\cf0 It  is important to remember that Cucumber specifications are executable.  Cucumber takes them and checks your code to see that you\'92ve have  actually implemented what the specifications demand. This is what makes  them magical. \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233\sa230
\cf0 However,  the scenario above is quite dull and software-specific. It lacks a  compelling narrative arc. No one would read this scenario for pleasure,  as one might a film script or a Jane Austen novel. <h2>What a more interesting Cucumber scenario looks like</h2> <pre><strong>Feature</strong>: Heritage preservation <strong>In order</strong> to keep communities healthy <strong>As</strong> a citizen <strong>I want</strong> old heritage buildings to be preserved</pre> <pre style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Scenario</strong>: Preserve unoccupied heritage buildings <strong>Given</strong> old building is heritage quality <strong>When</strong> no one is using the building productively <strong>Then</strong> the owner should preserve the building</pre> Here,  the example is less trivial and begins to talk about things that some  might find interesting. It expresses a policy specification for urban  preservation in a compact form. This could affect cities in a real way. \
Such  a scenario might be a good first step in creating an architectural  heritage inventory for cities in which heritage buildings are under some  threat (such as the city in which I live). One could craft a heritage  building application in the web application framework Ruby on Rails,  starting with simple scenarios just like that. <h2>What a Kaufman Cucumber scenario looks like</h2> Charlie Kaufman is a screenwriter and director, known for such wildly creative films as <em>Being John Malkovich</em>, <em>Adaptation</em>, and <em>Synecdoche, New York</em>.  He is one of the most creative people working in Hollywood today. Not  all people like his work or find his humour to be hilarious, but I do. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl233\sa230
\cf0 Kaufman  started as a screenwriter before becoming a director. His brilliant  cinematic ideas begin as words on the page -much as a software  developer working in an agile programing or behavior-driven development,  begins as words on the page. \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233\sa230
\cf0 In <em>Synecdoche, New York</em>,  Kaufman tells the story of a troubled theatre director who puts on an  absurdly ambitious theatrical event, which last several decades. This  theatre piece recreates New York in its entirety. It takes place on a  sound stage built in a warehouse in New York. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl231\sa230
\cf0 Since  the warehouse in which the piece occurs is also part of New York, this  means within the recreation of New York you also find the warehouse in  which the recreation takes place. This creates the opportunity to  represent an infinite recursion of warehouses inside of warehouses ad infinitum. The fact that Kaufman attempts to represent this recursion dramatically is brilliant and very funny. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl233\sa230
\cf0 What would the Charlie Kaufman Cucumber scenario look like for this? <pre><strong>Feature</strong>: Infinite recursion in dramatic representations<strong> In order</strong> to show the absurdity of excessive representational ambition in theatre <strong>As</strong> a film director <strong>I want</strong> to show that infinite recursion may lead to absurdity</pre> <pre style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Scenario</strong>: Warehouse in a warehouse <strong>Given</strong> all of NYC is portrayed dramatically in a warehouse <strong>When</strong> this warehouse is also part of NYC <strong>Then</strong> this leads to recursive representations of the warehouse, ad infinitum</pre> As a film <em>Synecdoche, New York</em> combines a touchingly melancholy tale of a man\'92s mortality with the  most absurdist type of humour. This means you laugh and cry  simultaneously when matching the film. This is no mean feat in cinema.  If only software were to inspire such emotions in their users! \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl233
\cf0 To  encourage more interesting software it must be a good idea to encourage  more creativity in the writing of software scenarios. As the Charlie  Kaufman example demonstrates this creativity can be quite open-ended,  humorous and lead in \
\pard\pardeftab720\li1417\fi-1418\sl233
\cf0 potentially absurd directions.]]></content:encoded> <excerpt:encoded><![CDATA[Is storytelling in film making similar to storytelling in software design? \

\pard\pardeftab720\sl233
\cf0 Last weekend, I went with my sons to a powerful art show at the Brantford Arts Block called Mush Hole Remembered: R. \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233\sa230
\cf0 G. Miller by the accomplished Mohawk artist R. Gary Miller-Lahiaaks (This show runs until April 9, 2011). \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl231\sa230
\cf0 The  best commentary on this show is that which is included in the show  itself. The artist and curator\'92s statements are powerful and moving.  These statements are found at the end of this post. \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233
\cf0 The  show consists of paintings and drawings inspired by Miller\'92s  experiences as a child inmate at the Mohawk Institution, \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl233\sa230
\cf0 a.k.a. the Mush  Hole. The Mohawk Institute was Brantford\'92s local Indian residential  school, closed down in 1969. This former school lies about 3 km from  downtown Brantford, near the banks of the meandering Grand River. \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233\sa230
\cf0 The  fact that the artist refers to himself as an inmate, as opposed to a  student, is indicative of the nature of the place. It was more a prison  than a school. The brutalizing tendencies of this institution was more  prominent than any educational intent or result. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl231\sa230
\cf0 Attending  the Mohawk Institute was an extremely painful experience for the  artist, which has reverberated throughout his adult life. Miller\'92s  experiences at the school included beatings, rapes and hunger. \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233\sa230
\cf0 The fact that places like the The Mohawk Institute exist is an inconvenient truth in Canadian history. \
Not  surprisingly, this early trauma created demons for Miller, which he has  had to overcome. One way he battles these demons is by producing art  and exhibiting his work. His process of healing is an ongoing one. <h2>Commentary</h2> <h3>The art</h3> The  works in the show are in a variety of media. The most prominent are  paintings of native boys and girls standing in front of the Mohawk  Institute. \
<a rel="attachment wp-att-1027" href="http://michaelcumming.com/2011/03/mush-hole-brantford/olympus-digital-camera4/"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1027" src="http://michaelcumming.com/wpcontent/uploads/2011/03/P3050854-2-280x300.jpg" alt="" width="280" height="300" /></a> \
The  children seem happy enough and appear to derive support and camaraderie  from each other. One message you might derive from these paintings is  that although the Mohawk Institute may have been brutal and racist, at  least the children had each other. I\'92m sure the reality was more nuanced  than that. \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233
\cf0 There  are drawings in the exhibition that suggest the Mohawk Institute was a  site of inhumanity on par with other physical and cultural genocides,  such as the Jewish Holocaust and the Cambodian killing fields. There are  images of skulls and of death cults. There is a drawing of an emaciated  figure reminiscent of the liberation of death camps in WWII. One large drawing of a crying child reminds me of the famous photograph of the Vietnamese <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phan_Th%E1%BB%8B_Kim_Ph%C3%BAc" target="_blank">girl</a> running from a napalm attack. A painting of a very young child suggests that  the abuse and horror of the Mohawk Institute were inflicted on even the  youngest inmates. \
\pard\pardeftab720\sa230\qc
\cf0 The Mohawk Institute is clearly represented by Miller as Brantford\'92s \'91Heart of Darkness.\'92 \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233\sa230
\cf0 <a rel="attachment wp-att-1038" href="http://michaelcumming.com/2011/03/mush-hole-brantford/olympus-digital-camera5/"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1038" src="http://michaelcumming.com/wpcontent/uploads/2011/03/P3050857-300x244.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="244" /></a> \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl233\sa230
\cf0 Buildings  have a prominent role in Miller\'92s paintings. They are painted in a  lurid, expressionistic style that suggests that despite a facade of Victorian respectability, unspeakable cruelties occurred inside. \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233\sa230
\cf0 <a rel="attachment wp-att-1041" href="http://michaelcumming.com/2011/03/mush-hole-brantford/olympus-digital-camera6/"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1041" src="http://michaelcumming.com/wpcontent/uploads/2011/03/P3050863-1-300x284.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="284" /></a> \
Also prominent in the artwork is the so-called <a href="http://www.mohawkchapel.ca/">Mohawk Chapel</a>,  which still stands across the road from the Mohawk Institute. The  Mohawk Chapel, whose official name is Her Majesty\'92s Royal Chapel of the  Mohawks (St Paul\'92s), was the first Protestant church in Upper Canada and  is now the oldest surviving church in Ontario. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl231\sa230
\cf0 In  Miller\'92s paintings these two institutions are joined together. In the  daily routines of the children, they were probably either at the Mohawk  Institute or they were across the road at the chapel. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl233\sa230
\cf0 However,  the proximity and relationship of the Mohawk Chapel to the Mohawk  Institute is a disquieting one. It was a close relationship between the  two power centres of the time: the church and the state. However, it was  a relationship that did not bode well for the humane treatment of  native children. \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233\sa230
\cf0 The  overall message of the exhibition is clear: native children suffered  greatly at the Mohawk Institute, that the artist was one such child who  suffered there and that this oppression was systemic, institutionalized  and supported by church and state working together. <h3>The final solution</h3> As  the curator Neal Keating writes: The Indian residential school system  was an attempt at a \'93final solution\'94 to Canada\'92s Indian problem. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl233\sa230
\cf0 The  reference to a \'91final solution\'92 is clearly eliminationist in spirit.  This is what ties the practices of the Mohawk Institute into instances  of genocide in other parts of the world. \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233\sa230
\cf0 There  is this two-fold aspect to such genocidal tendencies: one, that the  mere existence of a people presents some kind of threat or problem to a  dominant population, and two, that simply getting rid of the minority  population is a sensible way to address the manufactured problem. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl231\sa230
\cf0 The  Mohawk Institute closed in 1969, after 140 years of \'93killing the Indian  in the child.\'94 That is a long time for a system, which is today widely  considered as fundamentally racist and abusive. This system was not a  flash in the pan. It lasted far, far longer than the Nazi regime in  Germany, the killing fields era in Cambodia, the genocide in Rwanda and  even the apartheid regime in South Africa. <h3>Having your kids taken away</h3> A  particularly appalling aspect of the residential school system is the  fact that it involved forcibly separating children from their parents  and other communal care givers. \
Children were often removed from their  families at an early age. The level of care at residential schools was  typically brutal and oppressive. The mortality rates were shockingly  high. Some children spent most of their childhood in places like the  Mohawk Institute. The only reason that many native parents sent their  children to residential schools was because the government forced them  to. \
Children  were not allowed access to their language or culture. Indeed, this was  the whole point of the residential school system: to break the bonds of  traditional culture within aboriginal families. \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233
\cf0 If  the government does not trust you to raise your own children  adequately, this in effect devalues all of native culture. \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233\sa230
\cf0 Indeed, the  history of Canada like most other New World countries is noted for its  pervasive devaluation of native cultures. This process of devaluation  continues to this day. \
A  childhood spent in such appalling conditions is not conducive to  forming habits of self that serve you well in adulthood. A process of  self-alienation is expected to result in dissociative psychological  disorders and self-destructive behaviors. This is what Miller reports  happened to him. His experience at the Mohawk Institute is still a  raw wound. <h3>The system</h3> As  students of Canadian history are aware, the Indian residential school  system is one of the darker episodes of Canadian history. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl231\sa230
\cf0 For  those who study the system, it appears less like a curious anomaly in  Canadian history and more of an inherent aspect of native and non-native  relations in this country. The residential school system was systematic  and bureaucratic in nature, fully supported by the Government of  Canada. \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233\sa230
\cf0 In 2008, The Government of Canada apologized for the residential school system. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl231\sa230
\cf0 At  the time, it seemed like the apology was of some significance to First  Nations people but that it meant much less to those outside that  community. It is this asymmetrical nature of the apology that strikes me  as odd. \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233\sa230
\cf0 True  apologies involve some moral cost to those making the apology. It  should bring some sense of shame to some people. I am not sure that this  apology was of that type. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl231\sa230
\cf0 When  this apology occurred in was just another news item. It was like it  happened long ago and did not necessarily affect people today. Yet we  know from Miller\'92s work that the effects of the system reverberate loud  and clear in the minds of its victims. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl233\sa230
\cf0 Therefore,  I saw little psychological or emotional connection between the  non-native population--most of whom see it as an issue which doesn\'92t  affect them directly--and the very real psychological pain felt by First  Nations people. The <em>Schindler\'92s List</em> of the residential school system has yet to be made. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl231\sa230
\cf0 Canadians  haven\'92t arrived at the point where they see the racism and brutality of  the residential school system not as an incidental aspect of sending  native children away to learn from a supposedly superior culture, but as  its fundamental aspect. <h2>Conclusion</h2> Standing  in front of Brantford\'92s Mohawk Institute is a weird and disquieting  experience. You really do get the feeling that if these bricks could  talk they would tell a sad and painful tale. \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233\sa230
\cf0 There  is something about this city of Brantford, its meandering Grand River,  the former residential school with its spooky facade and grounds, the  nearby Mohawk Chapel, all of which are down the road from the largest  Indian reserve in Canada. There is a strange confluence of forces there,  which do not appear to be benign or entirely in the past. \
The  children in residential schools were inmates. Their only crime was that  they were aboriginal. Despite being completely innocent these children  were treated as if they were guilty of some unspeakable crime. The fact  that trauma was inflicted as a matter of government policy is a  continuing source of pain for First Nations. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl233\sa230
\cf0 The  artist R. Gary Miller suffered greatly under this system. His way  forward--his means of survival--was not to remain silent. He expresses  clearly through his art what the residential school system has done to  him. I applaud his courage. \
As  the curator Neal Keating writes \'93The curriculum of the Mohawk Institute  taught the artist that aboriginal culture was wrong, that aboriginal  language was forbidden and that aboriginal spirituality was particularly  abhorrent.\'94 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl231
\cf0 This  suggests that the opposite is likely true: that aboriginal culture is  as correct as any other and is worthy of respect, that aboriginal  languages are the bedrock of native culture and cannot be denied without  harming the culture in fundamental ways, and that native spirituality  is not only not abhorrent but likely presents the best approach in  healing from wounds afflicted by an aggressive and brutal alien culture. \

<h1>Statements from the exhibition</h1> <h2>Exhibition title</h2> MUSH HOLE REMEMBERED: R. G. MILLER \
"Mush Hole\'94 is the nickname for the Indian residential school that was officially  known as the Mohawk Institute. R. Gary Miller-Lahiaaks (Mohawk, b.  1950, Six Nations) was put into the Mush Hole in 1952, when he was 2  years old. He was kept there for the next 11 years, until 1963. As a  child-inmate in the Mush Hole, Miller was subjected to severe beatings,  repeated rapes, and chronic hunger. All this delivered by the non-Native adult supervisors who exercised total power over the Indian children\'92s  lives; this in the name of Christianity and Civilization. <h2>Artist\'92s statement</h2> This  exhibition represents a combination of vague, mundane memories of years  at the school, and flashes of horror experienced there. They are the  strongest memories I could approach without descending into a place I  would not be able to emerge from. \
This  project evolved from decades of need to express my personal outrage at  the world, combined with a moment of political timeliness. I thought it  would be groundbreaking and exciting to tackle - it turned into four  years of nightmares and breakdowns, until I realized I had a more  fragile grip on my center than I knew. This was as close as I could come  with sharing my story. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl231\sa230
\cf0 Perhaps  other Residential School Survivors will take up the gauntlet and excise  their demons in their own way. Mine have only been exposed - not  destroyed. l know now that I cannot carry on living on the surface of my  self. My artwork previous to the conception of this project has always  been an attempt to find a raison d'\'e9tre  and self-respect. I am incomplete and l need help to heal and achieve  peace with my past. You cannot cauterize an infected wound. \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233\sa230
\cf0 R. Gary Miller-Lahiaaks, 2008 <h2>Curator's Statement</h2> Sometimes  art is created for the purposes of revealing truths that hurt, and  performing a rite of exorcism. This is one of those occasions. Like tens  of thousands of other First Nations people alive in Canada today, R.  Gary Miller-Lahiaaks (Mohawk, b. 1950, Six Nations) is surviving the  Indian residential school experience. This exhibit is about that  experience, and the memory of trauma induced by a genocidal system aimed  at achieving a \'93final solution\'94 to Canada\'92s Indian problem. The  residential school that Miller was in was the Mohawk Institute, a.k.a.  \'93the Mush Hole,\'94 which finally closed down in 1969, after some 140 years  of \'93killing the Indian in the child.\'94 It is significant that the first  opening of this exhibit is taking place on the site of the former Mush Hole, which is today the Woodland Cultural Centre. \
R.  Gary Miller was put into the Mush Hole in the early 1950s, when he was  very young, two or three years old. He remained there for the next 11  years, until 1964. In the four decades since then he has been  hospitalized numerous times for a variety of psychiatric disorders. He  has repeatedly attempted suicide, been arrested for assault, wrecked his  marriages, and developed severe substance abuse and other health  problems. A common pattern is evident in the thick file of medical and  police records for Miller: when the doctors and nurses asked him why he  did it, he invariably answered that it was because of what happened to  him in the Mush Hole. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl233\sa230
\cf0 What  happened to him? Like many others, Miller's childhood was burned up in  the aboriginal holocaust of Canada. His young body was regularly beaten  for some nine years (starting at the age of four or live), serially  raped and molested for more than six years, and undernourished for all  eleven years. In addition to this, the curriculum of the Mohawk  Institute taught him that aboriginal culture was wrong, that aboriginal  language was forbidden, and that aboriginal spirituality was  particularly abhorrent. \

\cf0 <content:encoded><![CDATA[One  of the more distressing events of 2010 was the demolition in Brantford  of a heritage streetscape on the south side of Colborne St. What was  once a canal-side assemblage of interesting, historic buildings is now a  steep gradient covered in dark mulch. Apparently, the steepness of the  slope makes constructing new buildings on this site more expensive than usual. The city awaits for new ideas about what to do with this  prominent site. \

\cf0 Last week I attended a <a href="http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=206239949386947&amp;index=1" target="_blank">lecture</a> by Dr. Karen Dearlove who described the site in greater detail and  reflected on its relationship to the [now filled-in] canal at its base.  This part of the core of Brantford was the western end of a canal that  ended directly below where Colborne St hits the Grand River. This short canal  (called the 'Brantford Cut\'92) improved navigation along the Grand River by avoiding  a great meander in the river downstream of Brantford. The Grand River  Canal, of which the Cut was a part, became obsolete with the building of the railways in the 1860\'92s. \
The canal system fed an impressive industrial complex that manufactured farm machinery, in a part of town now known as the <a href="http://www.brantford.ca/govt/projects/brownfields/sites/Pages/GreenwichMohawkSite.aspx" target="_blank">Greenwich-Mohawk Brownfield Site</a>.  There are development proposals to maintain some of its  remaining industrial buildings and infill with new buildings in the  style of the old. This site is a about a kilometer from  the Colborne St site. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl231\sa230
\cf0 The  question remains why Brantford councilors felt in 2010 that it was a  good idea to demolish such a large quantity of urban heritage  architecture on the south side of Colborne St. \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233\sa230
\cf0 One theory that hadn't occurred to me is the <em>de-industrialization trauma  theory</em>, which goes something like this: Brantford experienced rapid  de-industrialization with the closing of several large factories in the  early 1980\'92s. The citizens of Brantford saw their city turn quickly from  an industrial giant into a relatively unimportant city. Many thousands  of people became unemployed and were therefore traumatized. They  expressed this trauma by devaluing the remnants of the old, such as  heritage streetscapes in the core. The future of the new Brantford was  not to include things that reminded the citizens of the old order; if  they removed evidence of this past then it became easier to cope with  their sudden loss of status. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl231\sa230
\cf0 I\'92m  not sure I buy this theory, since Brantford has managed to retain  many fine heritage buildings. Indeed, Brantford is currently  experiencing a mini-boom as a regional educational hub, which appears on  the whole to be beneficial to the preservation of its core. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl233\sa230
\cf0 But  the Colborne St destruction still resonates strongly in the minds of  those who fought to prevent it. Brantford lives on, but in a diminished  state. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl231
\cf0 Rehabilitation of the the Greenwich-Mohawk site and of the  adjacent canal system, which seems like such a promising development,  will have to do without the prominent landmark provided by the south  side of Colborne St at its western terminus.]]></content:encoded> \

I wonder who developed it. \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233\sa230
\cf0 Because there is a major flaw or two. \
The people who lost jobs and were ``traumatized`` did not have the power to tear down Colborne St as the majority of these industrial workers were working class, not city councilors.  Those most traumatized were hardly concerned with devaluing downtown buildings when they were now faced with no jobs and no money  and were more concerned with homelessness, how to feed their  family`s, fear of what was coming next. They did not have the energy, never mind the political savvy to play the tricks these city councilors played in order to have buildings torn down whent prohibited to do so and  without regard to the safety and welfare of  Brantford`s citizens (I was driving thru the area when the mushroom cloud of asbestos blew up without protecting the environment (even tho it was only a little bit) and shoved under the proverbial carpets so fast I was in awe. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl233\sa230
\cf0 The only people who did not want to look at those historical buildings, to  avoid looking at the old order, were councilors who are still hiding something. Some are in the know, most of us, ``the citizens`` are not. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl233
\cf0 Leading to the a more profound reason the theory is askew. I do not know how many councilors, potential majors and city hall staff say that the average ``citizen`` is too dumb to care,  don`t know how to vote, don`t understand why we need to conserve energy, and so on...often worded slightly less plain, however, meaning the same thing. If we don`t`` get it``, why on earth would we bother taking out our trauma on Colborne St 20 years later?]]></wp:comment_content> \

If I was Kahn I'd buy a cheap empty suit on council to front for the appropriation and demolition. \

\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl231\sa230
\cf0 One  of the most prominent issues of the current Canadian election campaign  is the idea of coalitions. Stephen Harper, the right wing Conservative  leader, presents them as an affront to Canadian values and all that is  right about our democracy. The absurd position, which has no historical  foundation, is not countered in any substantial way by the other  parties. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl233\sa230
\cf0 In  Canada, the left is splintered while the right is unified under Stephen  Harper. The only way that the left will assume power is to become as  unified as the right. This is made a little more difficult in the  Canadian context because one of the parties on the left  is the Bloc Qu\'e9b\'e9cois, a Quebec-only party that promotes sovereignty  for Quebec. \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233\sa230
\cf0 Therefore,  for the left to unify in a formal way, as a single party, would be a  difficult or impossible. The only way to unify it is to do so in a virtual  way--as some kind of coalition. This is not unusual in other countries  but is presented as something to be avoided at all costs by Harper. \
Harper  presents a coalition of the right as a natural phenomenon, while a  coalition of the left as an unholy alliance. All evidence seems to point  to Harper getting away with this misrepresentation. <h2>Let\'92s just cut out the left entirely</h2> In  the USA there exists a two party system. Hard right is now represented  by the Republican Party, while the center right, by the Democrats. Both  these parties are tireless in their efforts to support corporate  interests, with little or no regard to political concerns to their left. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl231\sa230
\cf0 In  the USA, the left is not unified under the umbrella of the Democratic  Party. It is simply absent from the political party system entirely. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl233\sa230
\cf0 This  \'91democratic deficit\'92 and limited range of political options in the USA makes it an  anomaly compared to many other western democracies, where leftist  parties do exist and sometimes have real influence in the political  sphere. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl231\sa230
\cf0 Harper  wants Canadians to believe they live under a similar political  construct, in which the right assumes a natural  right to govern while the left is effectively disenfranchised. \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233\sa230
\cf0 What favors Harper in the popular imagination is a basic misunderstanding of the parliamentary system. <h2>This is not the USA</h2> In  a republican system as found in the USA voters elect a president  directly. The candidate who gets the most votes gets to be president. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl233\sa230
\cf0 In  a parliamentary system, you elect your local member of parliament. You  do not elect the prime minister directly. The prime minister is the  person who manages to acquire the \'91confidence of the house.\'92 This is  usually, but not always, the leader of the dominant political party in  parliament. \
In  the USA, there are profound checks and balances on the power of a  president. In Canada such checks do not exist because the role of a  president does not exist. \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233
\cf0 Harper  wants to be a president, but one with few checks and balances. The Canadian  system is not set up to accommodate \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233\sa230
\cf0 such a position. In fact, the US  system is not set up for such a position either. \
A  parliamentary system is not necessarily superior or more democratic  than a republican one, it is simply structured in a profoundly different  way. It is the misunderstandings of the these differences by the voting  public that Harper hopes to exploit. <h2>Working with others</h2> In  a parliamentary system, a leader in a minority situation must work with  the members of other parties to get things done. If a ruling party  lacks the confidence of others, the government will fall and another  election will be called. This has happened to Harper several times. \
Harper  has difficulty in gaining the confidence of those with opposing  political views. He does not work well with others-especially with  parties to his left, which includes all other parties in Canada\'92s  parliament. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl231\sa230
\cf0 Harper  is greatly offended by the idea that when he is in a minority position,  he must work with members of other parties. He would prefer not to have  to do this, but when in he's in a minority he has no other choice. \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233\sa230
\cf0 He  proposes that the only sensible option is for Canadians to elect him to  a majority, which would allow him to escape the \'91bickering\'92 and rule in  a way unconstrained by consensus-building protocols. He wants a  majority in order to centralize all political power in himself and to  ignore all others. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl231\sa230
\cf0 Judging  by his recent record, he clearly wants to set himself up as a petty  dictator, but one who supposedly derives his legitimacy within the  parliamentary system. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl233\sa230
\cf0 Harper  wants to be a father figure, whose authority is unquestioned either by  the voting public or by other members of parliament--even those within  his own party. Such an overtly authoritarian and patriarchal politician  is rare in Canadian history. <h2>Conclusion</h2> When  Stephen Harper rails against coalitions, he misrepresents the basic  structure of the parliamentary system under which he works. He is, in  fact, making it up as he goes along. \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233\sa230
\cf0 Many  Canadians find this political tactic disingenuous in the extreme. They  are rightfully worried about the fragile state of our democracy. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl231
\cf0 Clearly,  Canadians need to learn a little bit about the basic structure of our  parliamentary system. Without this knowledge they will be victims to  well-spoken demagogues like Harper who are willing and able to subvert  the system under which they work in strikingly undemocratic ways.]]></content:encoded> \

\pard\pardeftab720\sl233\sa230
\cf0 This  week the RIM PlayBook tablet computer was launched. It is probably a  decent machine with some compelling design features but it has received  some scathing reviews. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl231\sa230
\cf0 Tablet  makers are currently in a frenzied catch-up mode to Apple. They are  trying to duplicate the stunning success of the iPad. If a tablet  manufacturer is to be successful in this fight they have to come up with  some truly innovative ideas that create real buzz, as opposed to say,  ridicule. \
One  thing that stuck out with the RIM PlayBook is its lack of an email  program. Not including an email program in a tablet computer is  comparable to launching a new car without windows that roll down or a  radio that turns on. \
When  I read about that deficiency I scratched my head and chuckled. What  were they thinking? Were they actually trying to make the front page of The Onion, or perhaps there is some structural deficiency in their  design thinking. \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233\sa230
\cf0 I think it might be a good time to explore some aspects of the RIM model and provide some cultural context. \
RIM is located in the small southern Ontario city of Waterloo. Waterloo is about one and a half hours drive west of Toronto. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl233\sa230
\cf0 Southern  Ontario is a part of Canada that some of us view as the natural  economic, educational and cultural heartland of English Canada. This  smug feeling of superiority the rest of Canada naturally detests. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl231\sa230
\cf0 Waterloo  is usually portrayed as the science and technological hub of Canada.  RIM has its headquarters there, as do other successful tech companies  such as OpenText. \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233\sa230
\cf0 RIM  grew out of work done at the University of Waterloo, which is one of  Canada\'92s prime research universities. This university is renowned for  the excellence of its research in many fields including math, computer  science and engineering. It has the reputation of being young, smart and  ambitious. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl233\sa230
\cf0 Similar  to how Stanford is the reason why Silicon Valley is where it is, the Waterloo technology hub exists because of its proximity to the  University of Waterloo. \
If  some of the smartest people are in Waterloo and RIM is the wunderkind  of Canadian technology, then why would they launch a tablet with such  obvious and laughable deficiencies? \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233\sa230
\cf0 No  one would claim that they aren\'92t smart up in Waterloo. But maybe being  smart is not enough, or perhaps they are smart but in a particularly  unhelpful way. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl231\sa230
\cf0 I  have some history with Waterloo but I admit they I have little direct  knowledge of Waterloo\'92s current culture except having driving through it  several times and stopping on occasion at its impressive Perimeter  Institute. I am sure that many nice people live and work in Waterloo. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl233
\cf0 Waterloo  is an attractive place, but in a white-bread, buttoned-down, suburban  kind of way. If you are looking for gritty urban living of a kind found  in Brooklyn, East-end London or Istanbul, you would be well-advised to  look elsewhere. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl231\sa230
\cf0 The  nearby city of Kitchener seems to have more historical buildings than  Waterloo and has a grungier, more working class appeal. Kitchener is  renovating some of its old factories to attract the hipster crowd. This  appeal to sustainability and historical preservation seems to be working  out well and is creating substantial interest in the business  community. \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233\sa230
\cf0 Yet, Waterloo is stuck in a corporate-campus type setting in which truly urban attractions and experiences are less prevalent. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl233\sa230
\cf0 There  is something just a hit nerdy about Waterloo. It has traditionally  attracted the pocket-protector set: those with more skills in  mathematics than in art or socially disruptive thinking. \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233\sa230
\cf0 Maybe RIM and its PlayBook suffers from this approach to technology. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl231\sa230
\cf0 RIM  has the reputation being a darling of corporate types. Its main  competitive advantage is the interoperability of its devices within secure  corporate data networks. To many, this is a key advantage. \
But  to those outside the corporate or business realm this is much less of a  compelling feature. In fact, it works against being seen as \'91cool.\'92 \
Data  security is a good thing but it is not the only thing. Security should  not trump all other concerns. Usability, openness and overall innovation  must also be important design considerations. \
Many  view the recent global recession as somehow engineered or caused by the  excesses of western capitalism. For a company that hopes to design  devices with some broad consumer appeal, being allied with  multinationals and their preference for secure data is not necessarily  an advantageous position. \
There  are only so many corporate types in the world, whereas there are huge  numbers of non-corporate types. It is this broader-based consumer market  that the likes of Apple and Google are in a much better position to  exploit. \
RIM  is left on the sidelines serving a privileged corporate culture. RIM is  further marginalized by its obscure Canadian origins, in a world where  Canadian multinationals are not seen as being particularly progressive  or innovative. \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233\sa230
\cf0 Compare the engineering-driven culture of Waterloo with that of Silicon Valley in California. \
One  of the reasons that the Bay Area is such a great success is that the  engineer-driven culture of Silicon Valley is balanced by the artistic  anarchism and free-spirit of nearby San Francisco and Berkeley. It is  the land both of Stanford and its straight A students, but also of the  Black Panthers and of environmental activism. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl233\sa230
\cf0 There  is something electric in the air of the Bay Area, which seems missing  in a place like Waterloo. Waterloo appears to have all the nerdiness of  Silicon Valley but without the inspiring counterpoint of free-love and  of new ways of organizing society. \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233\sa230
\cf0 This  makes Waterloo an attractive place of employment for some but not a  sympathetic place to live as a free-spirited artist or even as an  open-source programmer. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl233\sa230
\cf0 If  one has some interest is those kinds of alternative lifestyles then one  should explore the downtown districts of Toronto, or even Hamilton,  rather than Waterloo. \
Exploration  of social alternatives is necessary to come to a point where real  innovation is possible. Innovation and social conformity do not always  make great bedfellows. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl231\sa230
\cf0 RIM  and Waterloo have the reputation of being steady and reliable places in  which to produce conventional work. However, what is now required is  unconventional work. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl231
\cf0 If  RIM is to become a success in fields such as the design of  consumer-friendly devices, it must ditch its joined-at-the-hip  connection to the corporate world and explore its inner anarchist. \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233
\cf0 RIM, in short, must either innovate or die.]]></content:encoded> \

\pard\pardeftab720\fi1417\ri0\sl231\sa230
\cf0 <content:encoded><![CDATA[This  morning we woke up to a new political map in Canada. The Conservative  Party, led by Stephen Harper, won a decisive majority while the Liberals  under Michael Ignatieff were routed. These two events are not hugely  surprising given the political strengths of Harper and the political  weaknesses of Ignatieff. But what was dumbfounding was the dramatic  success of the left-most mainstream party: the New Democratic Party  (NDP) under the personable Jack Layton. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl233\sa230
\cf0 What  was also quite unexpected--until the last couple weeks of the  campaign--is how in Quebec the nationalist Bloc Qu\'e9b\'e9cois (BQ) was  largely replaced by the federalist NDP. This is a seismic event in  Canadian politics, even more significant perhaps than the success of the  NDP overall. \
What  this means is that in Quebec voters are willing to support a federalist  party--that is, one not devoted to making Quebec a separate country.  The Qu\'e9b\'e9cois are now willing to participate in Canadian politics at the  national level. They had a choice between social democracy and  nationalism and they chose social democracy. This is very surprising. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl231\sa230
\cf0 Previously,  when the BQ held a substantial number of seats in Canada\'92s Parliament,  the center-left vote in Canada was split between three parties: the BQ  (which the rest of the country was not able to support since they ran no  candidates outside of Quebec), the Liberals and the NDP. \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233\sa230
\cf0 This split enabled the consolidated right under Harper to assume power. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl231\sa230
\cf0 This  election now has had the effect of consolidating the left in Canada  under the NDP. This has never happened before in Canadian politics. \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233\sa230
\cf0 During  this election, the electorate was polarized. Voters could either follow  Harper and his brand of western-based conservatism, or they could  support a party whose left-wing, worker-friendly values have never been  in question: the NDP. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl233\sa230
\cf0 The  Conservatives and the NDP involve two distinct visions of Canada\'92s  future: either a US-influenced neo-conservative vision, or a  European-influenced social democratic vision. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl231\sa230
\cf0 In  Canada, if you are conservative you will never vote for the NDP, and if  you are a lefty you will never vote for the Conservatives under Harper. With these election results the political polarization is now almost comically complete. It is  unclear whether this is a good thing or a bad thing. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl233\sa230
\cf0 But  what it does enable is an opportunity for both the left and the right  to fully define their positions and to articulate the implications they  have for the future of Canada. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl231\sa230
\cf0 On reason the  Liberals were routed because it was unclear which side of this fence  they were situated. Did they believe in the immigrant-friendly welfare  state--which their party largely created--or did they not? \
Ignatieff  muddied this issue and made it difficult for many voters to support  him. It was not only his political acumen and personality that was at  issue, it was the clarity of his basic political position. \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233
\cf0 The Liberal Party experience in Canada could be compared to that of the Obama Democrats in the USA. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl233\sa230
\cf0 Obama  is not liberal enough to appeal to the traditional urban Democratic  base, nor is he credible as a centre-right politician who can appeal  convincingly to US nationalism and the projection of American power  around the globe. \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233\sa230
\cf0 In  other words, Obama is not left enough for the lefties, yet not right  enough to appeal to a suburban electorate. If he is not careful Obama  may face a similar fate to that of Ignatieff. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl231\sa230
\cf0 In  Canada, though, if any party is to assume the mantle of the curious  Canadian concept of the \'91Natural Governing Party\'92 they must be both  immigrant-friendly in a convincing, non-patronizing way and they must  manage the country is an economically sound manner. Canadians wisely see  their immigrants as their future, and prefer to be rich rather than  poor. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl233
\cf0 It  is too early to tell whether the right or the left will be able to  convince the electorate of their skills in these two areas.]]></content:encoded> \

\pard\pardeftab720\fi1417\ri0\sl231\sa230
\cf0 <content:encoded><![CDATA[The recent, unexpected killing of Osama bin Laden in Pakistan has raised several interesting points. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl233\sa230
\cf0 First, is this article from the Nation: <a href="http://www.thenation.com/blog/160310/osama-bin-laden-dead-its-time-endwar-terror">With Osama bin Laden Dead, It's Time to End the 'War on Terror.'</a> \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233\sa230
\cf0 Clearly,  the war on terror has very little to do with the continued existence or  not of Osama bin Laden, or his ilk. It appears to have much more to do  with domestic politics in the USA. The war on terror was a war conceived  for US domestic consumption, despite the undeniable hideousness and  suffering of 9/11, and despite bin Laden\'92s almost certain complicity in  that tragedy. \
In order for this war to end, there must be a change in US domestic politics, which I can\'92t see happening anytime soon. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl233\sa230
\cf0 Operations  such as the bin Laden killing are known as Black Ops. Obama is expected  to do well politically as a result of this one. People dancing in Times  Square is to be expected. Americans shouldn\'92t be surprised though if  the dancing is more restrained outside of the US. \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233\sa230
\cf0 Another  thing to consider is a comment I heard yesterday from an English  phone-in caller to the CBC. He said something like this: even at the  height of the IRA crisis in Britain, police there refrained from openly  assassinating their enemies (not to say that they never did such a  thing). But now it appears that in the US, Black Ops are the order of  the day. He thought it odd that no one was talking about this. When did  it become acceptable to brazenly assassinate your enemies--especially  those in foreign countries? Is this really a good idea? \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl233\sa230
\cf0 Of  course of all the enemies the US has ever had, Osama is the one you  would most likely want to kill. I bet even the Quakers would line up to  get that guy. \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233\sa230
\cf0 One  problem with Black Ops is that they\'92re <em>black</em>. This means they are  illicit and that they derive a lot of their power because they aren\'92t  talked about openly, in polite company. When they become a basic foreign  policy technique-which a president proudly and openly announces at a  press conference--then they get a little tawdry. It is like UFC cage matches suddenly becoming popular and then held in the Rose Garden of  the White House. They might please the crowds but they also might diminish the respectability of the Presidency. \
Black  Ops are greatly effective in eliminating your enemies (when they work  out as planned). They certainly serve to demonstrate the effectiveness  and skill of the US military for targeted, Shin Bet style killings. What  might be in question is the idea that physically eliminating your  enemies is always wise. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl231\sa230
\cf0 Such operations must not only <em>feel</em> good, they must do something positive for the fortunes of the USA for them to be considered successful. \
Bin  Laden was demonized not only because he was a murderous terrorist, but  also because he had the temerity to mount a private Black Op of his own  against the sole remaining superpower. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl228\sa230
\cf0 Countries other than the USA are of course strongly discouraged from mounting their own Black Ops against <em>their</em> enemies. This is a form of American exceptionalism that the rest of the world may resent. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl231\sa230
\cf0 The  Bin Laden killing reminds me of a widely circulated news item around the  time of the start of the war in Afghanistan. A young man with a  bellicose bent proudly announced that the the USA was the new \'91Roman  Empire\'92 and that the world would just have to get used to that fact. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl233\sa230
\cf0 At the time I thought it was an odd thing to compare ones country--Land of the Free, Home of the Brave--to the Roman Empire. \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233\sa230
\cf0 Wasn't  this the same Roman Empire notable for its cruelty and decadence? And  weren\'92t the Romans--who in addition to their military might and grand  architecture--known as a civilization that eventually went into a long  period of decline and eventually fell? \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl231\sa230
\cf0 Yet,  it appears this irony was lost on the man. He liked the sound of the  empire idea--with a military that could kick butt with impunity--but  without considering any of its potential downsides. \
As  the Romans clearly demonstrated, military power is only one aspect of  power. Economic and moral power still count for something, and empires can  sometimes become burdensome to their owners. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl233\sa230
\cf0 One  of the downsides of being the sole superpower is that there is a  tendency to pursue international relations as if their domestic  political outcomes is the only thing that needs to be considered. It is  like a Roman Empire frame of mind, but conceived by someone who has  never left Peoria. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl231\sa230
\cf0 This  attitude (also common in Canada under Harper) is short-sighted,  parochial and often counter-productive to national interests. It works  directly against seeing the \'91big picture,\'92 which you would think would  be needed to maintain superpower status for long. \
It  comes as no surprise that Osama was hiding away in a secure compound in  a garrison town in Pakistan. If he were hiding behind the Burger King  in McLean, Virginia, now <em>that</em> would have been a surprise. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl233
\cf0 Finally, what struck me as really odd is the fact that Osama\'92s body was buried at sea. Now, how do we know if anything <em>really</em> happened in Abbottabad? Conspiracy theorists: start your engines!]]></content:encoded> \

\cf0 <content:encoded><![CDATA[After reading a few things I have reassessed some opinions regarding the recent Canadian election. \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233\sa230
\cf0 Clearly,  what happened in Quebec was not a rejection of nationalism in favour of  social democracy. It was just that Quebec voters got tired of the old  guy Duceppe and wanted a change. They didn\'92t like what either the  Conservatives or the Liberals had to offer--since both of these are  tired brands at times--so chose the NDP. Their choice of the NDP is not  the beginning of a committed relationship, it is more like a one night  stand (that will last for four years). This romance could end at any  time. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl231\sa230
\cf0 The  Liberals are not dead. They will just lay dormant for awhile until they  acquire a charismatic leader (Justin Trudeau anyone?). \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl233\sa230
\cf0 The  idea that the country as a whole is making a permanent shift to the  right or the left is premature. Those from Alberta would like to think  so but their political culture, which involves both a one party state  and the unsavory anti-environmentalism of the resource extraction  industries, cannot be easily applied to the other regions of Canada. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl231\sa230
\cf0 One  of the great weaknesses of Harper is that his environmental record is  absolutely pathetic. Conservative parties elsewhere in Western countries  may even be bothered by what Harper appears to believe in: let\'92s do  nothing and hope no one notices. Anti-environmentalism is not  necessarily a left-wing issue. Conservatives, too, occasionally wish to  conserve things. \
Harper\'92s  anti-environmentalism really makes us look bad overseas: you can dress  him up but you can\'92t take him to Copenhagen. You may not want to become  Copenhagen but you don\'92t want the people there to hate you. \
International  reputations for countries like Canada are worth big money. Squandering  reputations waste money. This is an odd approach for a supposedly  fiscally-responsible conservative government. \
Anti-environmentalism  is not a sustainable political strategy. Soon, voters will expect all  parties to pay lip service to it. Canadians may or may not value social  democracy but they do value environmental issues, if well presented. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl233\sa230
\cf0 Therefore,  the party that could really do well in the next four years is the  Greens. Their leader Elizabeth May sounds creative, intelligent and  articulate. \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233
\cf0 Here  are some things that all parties must become known for if they want to  avoid ritualized Kim Campbell/Michael Ignatieff-style humiliations: <ol> \
\pard\pardeftab720\fi710\sl231
\cf0 <li>Connect with immigrants and the youth. These people are the future of Canada.</li> \
\pard\pardeftab720\li710\sl231
\cf0 <li>Be fiscally responsible and do not waste money on non-value producing programs (e.g. prisons).</li> \
<li>Address environmental issues such that money, resources and reputations are not wasted.</li> \
\pard\pardeftab720\fi710\sl231
\cf0 <li>Repair  our international reputation such that Canada has real friendships not  only with people with money \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233
\cf0 (e.g. the Chinese) but also with people with  moral integrity and courage (e.g. the people who began the revolutions  in Tunisia and Egypt).</li> </ol>]]></content:encoded> \

\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl231\sa230
\cf0 Congressman  King, I don\'92t think the main issue is whether waterboarding worked or  not, the main issue--which is as clear as day in almost all places, in  all minds that have a molecule of rationality, sensibility or  compassion--is whether waterboarding is morally reprehensible or not. \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233\sa230
\cf0 It is similar to arguing whether slavery \'91worked\'92 because it happened to raise the GDP of the confederate states. \
Clearly,  when it involves torture, in normal political discourse outside of  Stalinist Russia or Khmer Rouge Cambodia, ends don\'92t justify the means. \
It deserves a nanosecond of reflection to utterly reject such reasoning as that by King. No, make that less than a nanosecond. \
I thought we were past all such nonsense--and it is complete nonsense--laughably so [read about it next in The Onion]. \

\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl231\sa230
\cf0 Every  year in Stoney Creek, Ontario for the last 30 years people have reenacted the  Battle of Stoney Creek. This was a small but pivotal battle between the Americans and the British during the War of 1812. \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233\sa230
\cf0 The  British at the time were a great European power while the US were  destined to become a great North American power. The Americans were just establishing their nationhood, their standing army and  their military capability. The British on the other hand had one of the  most professional and disciplined armies in the world. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl233\sa230
\cf0 The War of 1812 is usually portrayed as a battle between two settler  nations: the British (helped by Canadian militias and its native allies)  and the Americans. Later in the 19th century, both the Americans and  the British did rather well for themselves. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl231\sa230
\cf0 The  natives were of essential help in helping the British defend itself  against the American invasion. They knew the land much more intimately  than the British. Their keen sense of how  to survive in the northern woods was honed by thousands of years of  settlement. Their dwellings and clothing appear the most suitable for  warfare in northern forests. They were also known as fierce and skillful  warriors who could terrorize their enemies. \
Yet,  as the actor portraying Chief Tecumseh at the reenactment explained, the  native side did less well as result of the war than the British or the Americans. Despite their help in helping the British not lose the war,  the natives were the only side that can be said to have \'91lost\'92 this war:  their traditional way of life, their political autonomy and the hold on  their territory was soon to be greatly diminished by the influx of mostly white  settlers. \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233\sa230
\cf0 Southern  Ontario and in particular the Niagara region, then as now, was an attractive target of invasion: a  fruit-belt with a mild climate, with important centres of population,  adjacent to impressive lakes and other natural waterways and with some of the most productive farmland in the region. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl233\sa230
\cf0 As  luck would have it the War of 1812 was a draw and residents of Upper Canada  remained British, later Canadian. As a result of the War of 1812 most of  the current eastern boundaries between Canada and the US were  defined. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl231\sa230
\cf0 Therefore,  one of the war\'92s outcomes was the establishment of a stable frontier  between two large countries. This  has given the lands on either side of the border many years in which  the inhabitants didn\'92t have to worry too much about the possibility of  external invasion or other political or military calamities. Most other regions of the world cannot  claim such stability of their frontiers so early in their political history. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl233\sa230
\cf0 This was a type of \'91peace dividend\'92 for the region, which unfortunately did not extend to its aboriginal population. Their history after this war was one of increasing marginalization - rather than stability and growth. The reverberations of this process of marginalization are still felt strongly in the region and have yet to be addressed adequately on either side of the border. \

\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl233\sa230
\cf0 In yesterday\'92s Globe and Mail was an article by Sarah Hampson called \'91<a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/relationships/news-and-views/sarah-hampson/former-revolutionary-carmenaguirre-looks-back---in-heels/article2052417/singlepage/#articlecontent" target="_blank">The child of a revolution remembers</a>.\'92  It is an article about an ex-revolutionary named Carmen Aguirre who is  now a successful artist in Vancouver. Aguirre sounds very interesting  and has had an unusually unconventional upbringing. \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233\sa230
\cf0 Contained  within the article is a quote from Aguirre that is refreshingly open  and unfiltered, which raises issues seldom seen in Canadian newspapers: <blockquote>Despite  the calm her life in Canada has, she doesn\'92t enjoy being an immigrant. \'93The main stereotype that I deal with is this notion that somehow this  country is better than ours.\'94 A burst of derision follows. \'93It\'92s \'91Oh,  you must feel so lucky to be here.\'92\'94 Another laugh. \'93That\'92s so  incredibly insulting.\'94 She shoots a withering look my way. \'93Within the immigrant community, we talk this way, but not outside. It\'92s the  politically correct thing to say, \'91Oh, isn\'92t it beautiful here?\'92\'94</blockquote> Clearly,  Hampson is less than enthralled about such opinions and seems more  interested in Aguirre\'92s clothing than her ideas, but Aguirre raises some  interesting points. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl231\sa230
\cf0 Canadians  expect to hear a conventional discourse from their immigrants. Canadians, like citizens of any other country, have constructed national  beliefs about immigration, which inside its borders tend to be accepted uncritically. If Canadians hear something different, such as what Aguirre eludes to, then they might be taken aback. \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233\sa230
\cf0 This  is not peculiar to Canada. All countries that are open to immigration  tell similar stories about themselves. It is not that the content of  Canadian stories is especially obnoxious or fanciful, but the fact that they are seldom critically examined and lack input from immigrants themselves that can be corrosive to the morale of some immigrants. \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233
\cf0 Canada  appears to do well in most cases with its immigration policy and its  immigrant experience. Many immigrants here appear to do quite well.  However, it is the \'91edge\'92 conditions, for instance people like Aguirre, where the immigration discourse can falter. <h2>Conventional Canadian thinking about immigration</h2> Here are some of the stories that Canadians like to tell themselves: <h3>Superiority of the new and inferiority of the old</h3> <ul> \
\pard\pardeftab720\fi710\ri0\sl233
\cf0 <li>When  people move countries, the country the immigrant is moving into (e.g.  Canada) is superior to the one they left behind (otherwise, why would  they want to immigrate?).</li> \
\pard\pardeftab720\li710\sl231
\cf0 <li>Immigrants who manage to make it to Canada are lucky and the ones who don\'92t are unlucky.</li> \
\pard\pardeftab720\fi710\ri0\sl231
\cf0 <li>Once  you immigrate to Canada the chance that you might find some other  country more attractive than Canada (with the possible exception of the  USA or New Zealand) is remote. Therefore, when you move to Canada your journey has ended. Congratulations!</li> \
\pard\pardeftab720\fi710\ri0\sl233
\cf0 <li>It  should be immediately apparent to the newcomer that no matter where  they might have come from, life is surely better in Canada. Therefore,  immigrants should experience joy when they arrive in Canada.</li> \
<li>After  an expected period of adjustment, the overall quality of life will be  better in Canada than the place the immigrant has left behind.</li> \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233\sa230
\cf0 </ul> Immigration  to Canada is generally seen as a journey that works in one direction only. Immigrants are not expected to move on from Canada. Canada is not seen as a way-point but as the final destination. \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233
\cf0 The  fact that immigrants took all the trouble of moving from one country to another is thought of as proof that what they find in Canada is superior to that which they left behind. <h3>Expectations of gratitude</h3> Countries  that allow immigration such as Canada expect that immigrants express some gratitude and humility towards their new country: <ul> \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl233
\cf0 <li>Since the new country is clearly superior, immigrants should be grateful to their new country.</li> <li>It is considered bad form to complain too vocally about the new country, at least within earshot of citizens.</li> <li>Adaptable  immigrants will find a way to succeed and be happy in Canada. Their  first step is to let go of their past and be thankful for their new  situation.</li> <li>Excessive complaints about their new home says more about the immigrant than about Canada and its treatment of immigrants.</li> \
\pard\pardeftab720\fi710\sl231
\cf0 <li>If  the newcomer finds things less than functional or advantageous to their situation, the immigrant should remain silent until that time they are  able to figure out how their new country works.</li> </ul> Whenever  an immigrant express discontent and disappointment in their new  situation then the immigrant is heartily invited to return to where they  came from. This appears to be the knee-jerk response from many who contribute comments to such stories in national newspapers: the proper  role of immigrants is to not broach any hint of complaint. If they do,  then they are breaking some unspoken rule. <h3>Of course you will be happy!</h3> Canada,  being a North American country in which the pursuit of personal happiness is a prominent goal, expects its immigrants to be happy: <ul> \
\pard\pardeftab720\li710\sl231
\cf0 <li>Immigrants  may not expect to be happy the moment they arrive in Canada. However, they tend to expect that \
\pard\pardeftab720\li710\fi-710\sl233
\cf0 eventually they, or their children, will be  happy.</li> <li>There are no structural impediments that prevent immigrants from being happy.</li> <li>If you're an immigrant then hard work contributes directly to your future happiness.</li> <li>If  an immigrant is not willing to do work that is demanding or occasionally demeaning, then the immigrants \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233
\cf0 lacks the personal resources  needed to succeed in their new country.</li> </ul> Canada  ranks highly in the places where residents profess to being happy.  Therefore, Canadians tend to expect its immigrants to be as happy as  they are, but without thinking too deeply about things that might make immigrants unhappy. <h3>Canada the beautiful</h3> Canada  has the self-image of being a particularly beautiful place. This idea is reinforced by some foreigners who appear to believe the same thing.  The idea that what attracts immigrants to move here involves the obvious beauty of Canada is a strong one in Canada: <ul> \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl231\qc
\cf0 <li>Newcomers  to Canada will find Canada to be a beautiful place. At minimum they are  expected to find the \
\pard\pardeftab720\li710\fi-710\sl233
\cf0 natural aspects of the country beautiful.</li> <li>The more resourceful of immigrants should also find the man-made aspects of Canada to be beautiful.</li> <li>Canada is likely more beautiful than the countries that immigrants come from.</li> <li>Beauty is something that attracts immigrants to Canada.</li> <li>The  beauty of Canada is something that will be a part of the lives of an  immigrant. It is not just a PR device to \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233\sa230
\cf0 attract outsiders, but is  actually a national reality that can be experienced wherever the immigrant may travel.</li> </ul> Canada  can in fact be a beautiful place but beauty is in the eye of the beholder. The idea that Canada is objectively-speaking a beautiful place tends to discount the notion that immigrants are frequently attached to the beauty of their own homelands. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl231
\cf0 Canadian  forms of beauty may also be an acquired taste: not everyone finds endless wheat fields, softwood forests with no hint of human settlement,  or even mountains beautiful at first. That which is considered beautiful by a society tends to be \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233\sa230
\cf0 socially constructed. Immigrants initially may have quite different notions of beauty. \
The  things which Canadians usually present as being beautiful tend to be non-urban experiences often far removed from the daily immigrant  experience, of say, waiting for the bus to get home. <h3>Canadians are nice</h3> One  thing that you find in Canada is their pride in being \'91nice\'92 people--definitely nicer than usual. Canadians have this idea that they are  nicer than most and that being proud about being nice is  non-controversial--since it is so obviously true! \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl231\sa230
\cf0 It  is not only Canadians who feel this way. You sometimes hear Americans say this as well (a line of discourse that I like to quash as soon as it  surfaces). \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233\sa230
\cf0 \'91Niceness\'92 is similar to beauty. Just as Canada can in fact be beautiful, Canadians frequently are nice--even to immigrants. \
However, the idea that Canadians can self-assess themselves as being nice is as  suspect as the notion that Canadians can self-assess their own national  beauty: it is a generalization that can quickly become oppressive, self-serving and contrary to everyday experience. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl231\sa230
\cf0 Whether Canadians are nicer than usual is beside the point--if in fact such a thing could ever be empirically established. What is more important is their attitude towards this belief. Is it really possible to be proud that you are nice and still be nice? \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl233\sa230
\cf0 It is similar to the paradox of being proud that you are humble, which also entails an inherent contradiction: your humility surely ends when your pride  begins. Does not your \'91niceness\'92 also end when your pride about it  begins? \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl231\sa230
\cf0 I  think Canadians sometimes tell themselves that they are nice without considering what outsiders, such as immigrants, might think of this  self-constructed belief. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl233\sa230
\cf0 This  relates to Aguirre\'92s perception of being insulted about having to feel that she is lucky by being here. Lucky she well might be, but it is insulting to be expected to feel this way from people who may know nothing about your prior experiences. <h2>My take on Canada</h2> Canada is a good place for many immigrants. Many immigrants to Canada do in fact build lives, which are more agreeable and productive than lives  they could expect to lead in their country of origin. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl231\sa230
\cf0 Canada can be a beautiful country in both its natural and man-made aspects. Canada\'92s history is surprisingly interesting. Canada can be a charming  place with an agreeable culture. \
However, the most prominent blight on the Canadian national experience and self-image is the shameful state of most of its aboriginal communities. Within these communities life can be very bleak indeed with sky-high rates of infant mortality, substance abuse, suicide and family disintegration. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl231
\cf0 This situation is dire yet seldom talked about. Canadians appear to consider the experience of its immigrants to be more important than the  experiences of its aboriginal communities. Unfortunately, this is a  black hole in the national consciousness that appears likely to remain.]]></content:encoded> \

\cf0 Two things that currently give me great pleasure are swimming and singing. I am a beginner singer but an experienced swimmer. Both of these activities are life-affirming and fun. Both require practice and take years to master. I have learned that both depend critically on learning how to breathe properly. \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233\sa230
\cf0 Breath control is a necessary yet not a sufficient condition for competent swimming and singing. \
Though, if you can\'92t get past the initial hurdles of learning to breathe then it is unlikely you will find much enjoyment from these two activities. But if you do, the rewards can be substantial. <h2 dir="ltr">Swimming</h2> When I get into the water I feel like I\'92m at home in a friendly environment. I have spent many hours swimming towards the bottom of pools and lakes, with not a care in the world. Underwater for me is a peaceful, relaxing place. But lately, I spend less time swimming to the bottom and more time lap-swimming in a chlorinated pool. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl231\sa230
\cf0 With swimming, what you want to avoid at all costs is the sensation of drowning. You get this feeling when water gets into your mouth or nose, and down your throat. Only a tiny bit of water is required. It is very unpleasant. \
Another annoyance is the tingling sensation when water gets too far up your nose. These sensations are what turn off many beginning swimmers. The trick to enjoying swimming, of course, is to avoid having these sensations at all. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl233\sa230
\cf0 To do this you need to blow out a steady stream of little bubbles out of your nose -- and sometimes your mouth -- so no water can get in; you use outflowing air to prevent the inflow of water. By blowing air out of your lungs underwater you also prepare for your next breath at the surface. \
When you know how to swim, you don\'92t think about breathing when you jump into a pool because those skills have been automated through practice. If you\'92ve achieved this automation, then you can concentrate on other things that might need improvement such as your strokes or body position. \
Or, you can simply enjoy swimming and let your mind wander. I sometimes get a lot of thinking done when my mind can wander productively. \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233\sa230
\cf0 One of the reasons I love swimming is that the breathing part causes me no concern or reason to panic. I don\'92t think about it at all; my body seems to know how to do it all on its own. <h2 dir="ltr">Singing</h2> Similarly, one goal of learning to sing is to be able to control your voice so you can produce musical tones without the feeling of panic and impending doom. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl231\sa230
\cf0 With singing there are lots of things to consider: the notes of the melody, their duration and what the lyrics are and what they mean. This can be a cognitively demanding activity -- especially when you don\'92t know how to sing very well. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl231
\cf0 However, in a performance situation you don\'92t want to be thinking too much. You want your \'91muscle memory\'92 to take over and your brain to go into autopilot. You need to automate as much of this skill as possible. This obviously requires lots of \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233\sa230
\cf0 practice. \
Singing without proper breath control can be like drowning. It is not as serious as drowning in water of course but I imagine it would be very debilitating and embarrassing during a performance. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl233\sa230
\cf0 The remedy is to remember to breathe (best done between words and phrases) and to use your breath efficiently while you sing. If you can\'92t do this, then just fake it and catch a breath as soon you can, without panicking. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl231\sa230
\cf0 Your vocal chords need air passing over them to create sound. Without this no sound comes out. If you run out of air at the wrong point, then you won\'92t be able to produce a sufficient volume of sound. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl233\sa230
\cf0 However, if you have lots of air in your lungs then you can fill a large, resonant hall with your dulcet tones, which can be very gratifying. \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233\sa230
\cf0 &nbsp; \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl231
\cf0 PS. if anyone needs vocal tuition in the Hamilton, Ontario area, I would highly recommend my singing teacher <a id="internal-source-marker_0.4246231557325225" href="http://www.lessonswithlucy.com/">Lucy Bledig</a>. She really knows her stuff.]]></content:encoded> \

\cf0 Happiness requires effort. People who do little tend not to be happy. People who go through terrible things are not necessarily miserable. Often they can be the happiest people around. \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233\sa230
\cf0 The great Italian humanist <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primo_Levi">Primo Levi</a> is a good example (though I believe he did suffer from depression later in life). Despite the fact he witnessed the Holocaust he was able to write a very moving literary account of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Survival-Auschwitz-Primo-Levi/dp/1463525567/ref=sr_1_5? ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1310749235&amp;sr=8-5">his experiences</a> in Auschwitz. I imagine that writing this must have required great effort. But we are so much richer as a result of his efforts. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl231\sa230
\cf0 I think about politicians who promote reactionary \'91solutions\'92 such as starting wars, policies that further stigmatize the poor and the disenfranchised, or even such relative trivialities as taking out existing bike lanes in car-clogged cities. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl233\sa230
\cf0 Are they following their own political ideology? Certainly. But another explanation is that maybe they\'92re just being lazy. They don\'92t expend the energy required to recognize the destructiveness of their words and actions. They don\'92t attempt to come to better-integrated solutions because such solutions are hard to come by and require effort--sometimes Herculean effort. If they did expend this energy they might realize that the most productive path may require subtleties of thought. \
Creative paths or policies tend not to destroy value. They enhance it. Not just for you and your pals, but for everyone. Politics need not be a zero-sum game. \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233\sa230
\cf0 Reaction takes less effort than creative thought because it depends so crucially on received opinion. Received opinion by its very nature is passive. Excessive passivity suggests laziness. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl233\sa230
\cf0 Sometimes the best idea is not the intuitive solution--it is often the counter-intuitive one. Quantum physics is the craziest thing you could ever think of, but it appears to run our universe. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl233
\cf0 To see the value in counter-intuitive solutions requires lots of thought and a consensus between other sentient beings that good ideas might sound crazy, but they also might just work.]]></content:encoded> \

\cf0 <content:encoded><![CDATA[Today, I read an <a href="http://www.thespec.com/news/local/article/565046--city-calls-off-non-essential-lrt-work">article</a> in the local paper that made me go \'93Oh no! Surely it can\'92t go that way!\'94 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl233\sa230
\cf0 The LRT (light rail transit, a scheme to use streetcars for public transit) seems like a smart idea -- one that will encourage productivity and the generation of cultural and material wealth in this city. I believe it will encourage urban revitalization and help to create a critical mass of other good things happening. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl231\sa230
\cf0 First, a personal disclosure. If the LRT is built it will help us personally: the proposed LRT B-line is down at the end of our street. It will surely raise our property values. But since the B-line is many kilometers long, many in this city might be in a similar position. \
There have been several articles in the last few weeks suggesting that the LRT concept doesn\'92t have much support from the current mayor and his city manager. \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233\sa230
\cf0 I believe that if this opportunity is not seized right now the momentum will be lost. \
There is an argument that all-day GO train service is more important than LRT. Most LRT supporters would not pit these two issues at odds with one another. They are surely complementary: all-day GO train suggests that much money for Hamilton can be made in Toronto, while the LRT plan suggests that money might be made right here in town. Both ideas should be able to co-exist in perfect harmony. <h3 dir="ltr">Transparency of decision-making</h3> One of the benefits of democracy is that decisions are made in an open manner. If a bad idea is about to be axed then it is clear from the public record why this occurred. If an idea is good and it gathers support from many sectors of the population then you expect it to do well. \
The enemy of democracy is the idea that the real decision-making takes place behind closed doors. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl231\sa230
\cf0 The reason that doors are usually closed in what is purportedly a democratic process is that the people making the decision to be not want to be held accountable for their own decisions. They want the power to make the decisions but not suffer the consequences if these decisions turn south. \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233\sa230
\cf0 This latest LRT decision seems to fail the transparency test. It is not clear why this LRT idea -- given the broad base of support which it has gained -- was so abruptly de-prioritized. Is there something here that the ordinary citizen is missing? <h3 dir="ltr">Post-industrial malaise and beyond</h3> One thing that really defines current-day Hamilton is the concern about what it wants to become when, and if, all its factories close. In the past, people made money and found employment from industrial production. In the future much less money will likely be made this way. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl233\sa230
\cf0 Hamilton puts itself on the \'91psycho-analytical couch\'92 perhaps more frequently than other places I lived because it really is puzzling what Hamilton should do for itself in future. I think the LRT debate involves such considerations. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl231\sa230
\cf0 What is clear is that new industries will need to spring up to fill the employment gaps created by the closure of hundreds of Hamilton\'92s former factories. The nature of these new industries is the source of much debate and anxiety. \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233
\cf0 This might be like the Pittsburgh experience, but one that is taking much, much longer. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl231\sa230
\cf0 In Pittsburgh it seems like the possibility of a reinvented industrialism was erased almost immediately by the unseemly and quick evacuation of almost all industrial production. If that city was to do well, then people saw that it must go \'91postindustrial.\'92 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl233\sa230
\cf0 The sudden loss of employment in Pittsburgh was both a blessing and a curse. A blessing because air quality improved overnight, but a curse because many hundreds of thousand of residents found they had to move from Pittsburgh in order to survive. \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233\sa230
\cf0 At least what this dramatic de-industrialization did was to focus the minds of its civic leaders. \
However, in In Hamilton there still might be possibilities of investment and employment in heavy industry. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl231\sa230
\cf0 Therefore, there is significant ambiguity here about whether a post-industrial future might be able to co-exist within a continuing industrial city. There is much to recommend such an idea. Hamilton needs all the money it can get. It is in no position to discourage future industrialization, despite how unattractive this might seem to those who prefer their Hamilton to be grit free. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl233\sa230
\cf0 Therefore, Hamilton may or may not be in the middle of a post-industrial malaise. Yet it may be generations before Hamilton is truly post-industrial. It is quite likely that to become truly \'91post-industrial\'92 is not even an appropriate goal for Hamilton. \
A knowledge economy is certainly attractive in many ways, but what seems most appropriate for Hamilton is a mixed knowledge/industrial economy. \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233\sa230
\cf0 If Hamilton\'92s economy remains mixed this makes the job of planning for future development trickier. Hamilton must acknowledge the important role that \'91dirty jobs\'92 play in this city while at the same time encourage -- in a forceful way -- the influx of people who have no interest in dirty jobs. <h3 dir="ltr">LRT and post-industrialization</h3> How then does this involve the LRT debate? \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl233\sa230
\cf0 I believe that the issue of whether Hamilton is to have a knowledge-based future or an industrial one is related to the acceptance of the LRT. \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233\sa230
\cf0 LRT seems more aligned to a post-industrial future, while \'91no LRT\'92 seems best suited to an industrial <em>status quo</em> political position. [I would be interested to know if there is any sociological support for this idea]. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl233\sa230
\cf0 In the LRT debate not only the appeal of various technical solutions are at issue but it is also a visioning exercise that involves the psyche of the whole city. What does Hamilton want to become? \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233\sa230
\cf0 In Hamilton there is often the hint of what kinds of pleasures are appropriate for an industrial city of its station. A familiar trope found in the civic discourse is \'91failures that originate in hubris.\'92 Perhaps the desire for an LRT system -- like what you find in the well-heeled cities of Europe -- is excessive and unseemly. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl233\sa230
\cf0 LRT opponents suggest that LRT is an inappropriate goal for Hamilton; that it is too fancy, costs too much money and that the public transit <em>status quo</em> is acceptable. LRT supporters counter that the LRT is not only an appropriate and sensible goal but actually the most financially rationally solution. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl233
\cf0 In the event that Hamilton fails to find its inner Pittsburgh and does not become completely post-industrial in short order, then is LRT still an appropriate solution to public transit and city-building? Many, including myself, believe yes.]]></content:encoded> \

In the USA the pattern for food portion size is \'91more is more.\'92 In the Netherlands it is \'91less is more.\'92As someone who watches his weight, I have come to appreciate the Dutch approach. \
In America, portion size is a market-driven phenomenon. There the market dictates that people should be presented with more food than they will ever need. Food in low-end restaurants -- which we tend to frequent -- is glossy, high in saturated fats and involves comically high calorie counts. We all know where this leads, and it isn\'92t pretty. \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233\sa230
\cf0 But as a tourist, this can be an attractive and entertaining proposal. \'93Let\'92s take another trip to the buffet, we\'92re on vacation!\'94 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl231\sa230
\cf0 This is fun in the short-term but it does encourage obesity. It is a lead anchor wrapped around the ankle of the American public. It is death by a thousand cookies. \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233\sa230
\cf0 Clearly, open buffets are more a threat to the survival of the USA than are jihadists. \'93We have found the enemy and it is us.\'94 \
The Netherlands, in contrast, is a deeply Calvinist country where food is looked on a necessity for sustaining life rather than a cheap entertainment, or something that will being pleasure. You eat to live, you don\'92t live to eat. New visitors are sometimes taken aback by this, trained as they are to view the Dutch purely through the prism of soft drugs and prostitution. \
I have been through many a Dutch office luncheon, which typical involves rolls with a single slice of cheese. They carefully count out the quantities required so if there are ten attendees there are exactly ten rolls. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl231\sa230
\cf0 When you first encounter this behavior you are taken aback, trained as we are to see an affluent society as one in which there is always more than enough to eat. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl233\sa230
\cf0 When the Dutch see food consumption become a pleasure they call this \'91Burgundian.\'92 This suggests a more Catholic, free and easy approach to food, as found in countries to the south such as Belgium and France. These countries are known for the quality of their food as well as a complete lack of Protestant guilt in consuming it. \
However, as a way to run a country there is much to be said about limiting caloric intake and fostering guilt in consuming more than you need. It lengthens lives and increases the quality of life. This is why the Dutch are so tall and slender. They save money, look great, all the time honouring their forebears who survived hard times with a few potatoes and a stinky herring, eaten from a wooden bowl. \
One thing about fatness is that the rich tend to be less fat than the poor. This is especially true in the USA. As Duchess of Windsor said: \'93You can never be too rich or too thin.\'94 In Pittsburgh, obesity appears to be a problem. In Manhattan, much less so. \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233\sa230
\cf0 By this logic, the Dutch take the path of the trophy wife or the socialite, while many Americans the path of those less interested in the social value of their appearance -- they depress their \'91market value\'92 by their discretionary, dietary behaviors. This is somewhat puzzling in a highly competitive, market-driven economy. In Europe it seems there is a socially acceptable \'91floor\'92 beneath which most prefer not to tread. \
Of course you can have both a highly developed \'91Burgundian\'92 approach to food, as well as a tendency not to become huge. This is what you find in many countries, such as France, Belgium or Japan. These places seem like the best of both worlds. Obesity there is less of an issue, while excellent restaurants attract both fat and thin. \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233
\cf0 This is probably why so many Dutch vacation in the south of France.]]></content:encoded> \

\pard\pardeftab720\sl233\sa230
\cf0 Yesterday at school, Ben had a demonstration of a road bike simulator that allowed him to compete and pedal against other kids. He won his race. He now has great enthusiasm for the idea that there is fun to be had behind dropped handlebars. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl233\sa230
\cf0 He had this brainwave in Dundas, Ontario which just so happens to be an excellent place for road biking. There is a charming road-bike themed cafe in the centre of Dundas as well as an excellent bike shop. Dundas lies directly under the Niagara Escarpment. Road bikers really like going up and down the Escarpment. \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233
\cf0 A teacher of Ben\'92s remarked that kids who pursue the sports of swimming, running and biking have the highest grade point averages in high school (which is something I didn\'92t know). It might be because these sports demand that the student focus intensely on repetitive, yet enjoyable, tasks.]]></content:encoded> \

\cf0 The provincial <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/story/2011/10/24/ontario-coroner-cycling-deathreview.html">coroner</a> will now examine the public health issues of cycling fatalities in the province. \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233\sa230
\cf0 This is a good move because it takes the cycling debate away from excessive politicization (e.g. \'91war against the car\'92) into a less heated, more evidence-based, epidemiological direction. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl233\sa230
\cf0 Most cyclists would agree that cycling in places like Toronto is much more dangerous than it needs to be. Lots of cyclists get killed. One reason is the limited scope of cycling infrastructure in the city. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl233
\cf0 Toronto has an increasingly crowded and chronically underfunded public transit system. Cycling should be a sensible way of getting around town. But too often it isn't. Many more people would cycle in Toronto if only it were made safer.]]></content:encoded> \

\cf0 <content:encoded><![CDATA[This is a reply to an email I received from the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/musictheoryguy?feature=watch" target="_blank">Music Theory Guy</a>, an English music teacher in a London secondary school who believes that music students should have a firm grounding in music theory [as do I]... \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233\sa230
\cf0 Hi Stephen, \
Thanks for your reply. It got me into thinking about what I like about your work and site. \
I think that people learning music really don\'92t get the basics about music theory. I think music is one of those things that you can do quite happily for years - perhaps your whole lifetime - and not understand the basics of music theory. In my case, I can play many instruments but have never had the sense that I really \'91get\'92 the fundamentals (I am a middle-aged architect and writer). \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl233\sa230
\cf0 This is fine for many who may lack an understanding of these basics but eventually they will hit a wall beyond which they will not be able to go further. Then they must go back and try to understand how the system works on a deeper level. For many this is too daunting a task. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl231\sa230
\cf0 For instance, if you want to start composing music then some knowledge of music theory is essential. I think a lot more people would compose if they just understood enough about how music theory works. Probably, lots of people don\'92t compose because of this reason. \
A lot of music theory involves acquiring an understanding how Standard Musical Notation works. This appears to be a very powerful system that abstracts out a lot of complexity. The more I learn about this system I more I can appreciate its power and elegance. \
Standard Musical Notation is similar to modern computer programming languages. The best ones abstract away a lot of complexity and allow the brain to begin to think creatively about the real problem at hand, which I believe is about self-expression and making deeper connection between ideas. \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233
\cf0 What I like about the Music Theory Guy approach: \
<ul> \
\pard\pardeftab720\li710\sl231
\cf0 <li>It assumes that anyone can learn this stuff, that is, music theory expressed in Standard Musical Notation</li> \
<li>It is appropriate for all ages</li> \
<li>It goes step by step and it is modular in approach</li> \
\pard\pardeftab720\fi710\sl231
\cf0 <li>It proposes that music theory is not some add-on at the end but that it is essential right from the start</li> \
\pard\pardeftab720\fi710\ri0\sl231
\cf0 <li>It doesn\'92t try to shame people if you don\'92t know it (why feel bad about something if it has never been adequately taught to you?)</li> \
\pard\pardeftab720\fi710\sl231\sa230
\cf0 <li>It explains it in a way that is just about impossible to not understand, if you go through your material enough times.</li> </ul> I find I go through your videos many times because I find them soothing to listen to. I will never tire of hearing about the Circle of Fifths, which I consider to have information packed into it than anything else I know. [Perhaps I should finally commit this thing to memory!] \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl233
\cf0 I have no criticisms of your approach whatsoever. I would just like you to keep on going. This I see as an open-ended process that could go on forever. \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233\sa230
\cf0 If you were to keep on going on this project then eventually you would be explaining ideas about modern music which most assume are completely beyond their understanding. You would have provided for the public an unbroken chain of tuition which could help many to get to an advanced level of musical understanding. This I see as a significant accomplishment. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl233
\cf0 The questions I have about music theory are (these are just ideas for future work, not as requests for information): <ul> \
\pard\pardeftab720\fi710\ri0\sl233
\cf0 <li>The standard musical notation system obviously has a long cultural history behind it. Will this system evolve or is it fine the way it is?</li> \
<li>Will future styles of serious or popular music eventually hit a wall in which the notation system will become inadequate? Will \'91reform\'92 of Standard Musical Notation ever become necessary?</li> \
\pard\pardeftab720\fi710\sl231
\cf0 <li>In my experience in software design, great progress is enabled sometimes with the design of new languages and systems of notation. Is music in a similar position?</li> </ul> On a more pedestrian note: <ul> \
<li>How do melodies and chord progressions work? Do they just use the notes of the key the song is in?</li> \
\pard\pardeftab720\fi710\ri0\sl233
\cf0 <li>The Nashville Numbering System seems like an accessible way of describing chord progressions and the structure of popular music. (e.g. 1, 5, 4 instead of I, V, IV). Does such an idea have any value in serious music education? </li> \
\pard\pardeftab720\fi710\sl231\sa230
\cf0 <li>Should children be taught how to compose at the same time they are taught how to play an instrument? (We have twin sons aged 11 who are fortunate to have an excellent music education program in their local state school). Do you think these boys should be taught how to compose, say in Sibelius Junior Version?</li> </ul> Thanks and look forward to seeing more Music Theory Guy videos in my inbox! \

I am one of those people who learned \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl231\sa230
\cf0 how to play musical instruments in school and along with that came the basics of music theory. I was never taught music composition. However my first marching band teacher, Mr. Campus, wrote about 75% of our music. It wasn't uncommon for him to pass out a piece (written in his crazy music notation scribbles), and then later tell us to play something a little bit different than what was written on paper (my first steps into improvisation perhaps). \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233\sa230
\cf0 I must admit, I did try to mimic him a bit...trying to come up with unique tunes and put them to paper. But I find no shortage of awesome music that has already been penned to play. And my creations pale in comparison. You always hear those stories of those people who never learned music theory and in fact, don't even know how to read music -- who become musical geniuses. That brings the question: Can music composition be learned, or is it something that you must have a talent for? \
It's interesting that my experience with computer programming is pretty similar. I enjoyed learning and using Java, C++ and various scripting languages. But I distinctly remember that when I wrote a program, my code would work, but it would always be considerably longer than my peers. My brain just doesn't have the knack for coming up with shortcuts and smart logical loop instructions that makes for short, efficient code. But that's ok....I have talents in other areas (so I would like to believe anyway). \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl231
\cf0 I wholeheartedly support long-term and thorough music instruction in schools. It makes the children into well-rounded learners. However I'm on the fence about music composition. I feel like that's an area that is similar to the relationship between physical education and sports. Everyone should take gym, but not everyone needs to be on the football team.]]></wp:comment_content> \

\cf0 education is basic to good education and well-connected neural development. I don't know if composition is like playing on the football team. It is a specialized thing but I also think it is a foundational thing that everyone should have a glimpse of\'97 like writing. It explains a lot that doesn't seem to get explained in normal music education. It seems to connect with a 'maker culture' mentality; that music is something to be created. Composition is just a slightly more formalized way of music creation.]]></wp:comment_content> \

\cf0 ns/_1070646/" rel="attachment wp-att-1555"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1555" title="Halifax's container terminal from Point Pleasant Park." src="http://michaelcumming.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/1070646300x200.jpg" alt="Halifax's container terminal from Point Pleasant Park." width="300" height="200" /></a></p> <p>Recently, I visited Halifax, Nova Scotia to celebrate my brother\'92s 60th birthday. I have a long history in Halifax. My parents, when they were alive, lived about 30km down the coast. I went to architecture school there. I know the city fairly well, yet I found this recent visit to be a bit different than previous ones.</p> <p>I have always liked visiting Halifax because it is a charming place with various seaside attractions, great wooden architecture, charming old buildings, military fortifications that you climb around on and an interesting waterfront. These things are still around.</p> <p>For English-speaking Canada it is older than most cities. It is not nearly as old as Montreal or Quebec City, but it doesn\'92t give the sense that it is a big-box mall pretending to be a real city. It is the real deal.</p> <p>In the past, despite the relative poverty of NS compared to Ontario there was always this sense that the government looked after most people, and that regardless, even if things were not that prosperous in the interior of the province, at least Halifax which is major regional service centre, would do alright.</p> <p>What surprised me is the contrast with where I live, Hamilton, Ontario. Previously, Ontario always was the \'91haveprovince,\'92 while Nova Scotia was the \'91have-not.\'92 This is why in previous generations, the traffic would usually go from Nova Scotia to Ontario, Quebec or out West. If you had ambition you would leave town for greener pastures. I found it hard to conceive of any other pattern until now.</p> <p>Now it looks like if you want to enjoy a charmed life, you might want to consider living in Halifax.</p> <p>Halifax has beautiful women jogging by in Lululemon gear, eager cyclists who look like they are rushing to a software design seminar. There is no shortage of trendy coffee shops, Japanese lunchtime spots and bike stores selling touring bikes that you could use to explore the Cabot Trail. It looks like a bit like pre-recession College St in Toronto.</p> <p>Halifax also has a fantastic full-length waterfront boardwalk and a state-of-the-art Farmer\'92s Market that would not look out of place in Zurich or Oslo. You can imagine well-heeled American tourists tripping over themselves to buy souvenirs in the shops or drinking micro-brews in dozens of stone-walled pubs.</p> <p>Ontario these days, on the other hand, is taking on some of the rust-belt characteristics of say an Ohio, Michigan or Pennsylvania: the implosion of a once-prosperous manufacturing sector, cities in which new investment or civic amenities go wanting, or even civic governments that care about what citizens want. There is gloom in the air here and many residents are at a loss in how they feel about that.</p> <p>Of course, the rest of the country, raised on the idea that Ontario always thought much too highly of itself and its alleged cultural advantages, is delighted in this reversal of fortunes.</p> <p>Things that a cities like Hamilton or Toronto might learn from Halifax:</p> <ul> <li>Civic amenities such as integrated bike path systems, farmer\'92s markets and waterfront boardwalks are very effective in attracting educated young people, as well as visitors. These people are always on the look out for new progressive places to set up shop (especially right after they get their professional degrees at Dalhousie).</li> <li>A place has to feel \'91cool\'92 in order to attract these kind of people. Perceptions of being cool come from many interactions that people might have while visiting and can\'92t easily be manufactured on demand.</li> <li>Reactionary or \'91Tea Party\'92 style politics is the opposite of cool. It is a symptom of a place in decline; it is when people with money feel that in order to protect what they have, they have to start oppressing those without. This tactic never works out very well for economic and cultural development in a city. A civic race to the bottom will never win any place new friends. Downward spirals are never pretty. Life cannot be not just about lowering taxes for people who already enjoy the fruits of the status quo.</li> <li>Political systems must give the appearance of being responsive to not only the practical aspects of life but also the deeper issues such as quality of life, art and design.</li> <li>A city is should at least appear to be interested in high design standards for new civic infrastructure and the idea that \
cities should have amenities that give pleasure. In places where the weather is not all that attractive, design can fill a very useful niche.</li> <li>Cities must work flat-out--continuously--to attract newcomers with new ideas and preferably a bit of money, otherwise they soon whither and die.</li> </ul> ]]></content:encoded> \

\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl233\sa230
\cf0 I just saw this 2008 film, which won an Best Actress Oscar for Kate Winslet. It is an unusual film in that it combines two things that are not commonly connected: the issues of illiteracy and of German guilt over the Holocaust. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl231\sa230
\cf0 The film is about an intense affair in the summer of 1958 between a gifted high school student named Michael Berg and an older but still attractive working-class woman named Hanna Schmitz, played by Kate Winslet. Hanna is a lonely, somewhat bitter person\'97a type not unusual in post-war Germany. Later it turns out this woman was an SS guard at Auschwitz who participated in atrocities during WWII. \
In The Reader the boy introduces Hanna to literature by reading to her. The boy is a conduit for this women to the world of literature\'97a world to which she has had little previous exposure. \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233\sa230
\cf0 This boy is a good position to be this conduit because he is lucky enough to be getting a good education within a classical system, which traditionally has had the goal of furthering the possibly counter-intuitive idea that books are the foundation of culture and that to understand what their contents mean is a necessary and perhaps sufficient aspect of becoming cultured. \
The thing that Hanna most values in her affair with the boy is having books which she has not yet read, read to her. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl231\sa230
\cf0 When the boy reads to Hanna at the beginning of their affair, he lacks two important bits of information: first, that Hanna is illiterate, and second, that she is a former guard at Auschwitz\'97a job which one can assume is soul-destroying for both its victims and perpetrators. \
Later, at her trial for war crimes, it becomes clear that an important, undisclosed factor in her choice of career path is influenced greatly by her illiteracy: she probably joined the SS in order to avoid having to read on the job. The film skillfully uses fact this not to excuse her behavior but to add an element of ambiguity to the moral choices she made. In the end, she is made a scapegoat for the institutionalized criminality involved in running extermination camps, which of course were designed to humiliate and eventually kill most of the people they processed. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl233\sa230
\cf0 In the movie, the Michael Berg character at Hanna\'92s trial is in a position to bring a crucial fact to the attention of the authorities: that Hanna was and is illiterate and couldn\'92t have been the one to write and organize the atrocity for which Hanna is being tried. She is guilty of a war crime certainly, but that she was probably not its ring-leader. \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233\sa230
\cf0 Berg decides to do nothing and his failure to act causes him pain. It is presented as him having the chance to step up to the plate but that he declined this opportunity. He let the moment pass and paid for his passivity for the greater part of his life. It is only much later, when he tries to connect to his estranged daughter that he begins to open up and start telling what he knows. The film implies that this opening up creates a new beginning for Berg. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl231\sa230
\cf0 In the context of the time, to defend a former SS guard, in a country which was eager to exploit scapegoats, would take significant courage. He lacked this courage at the time. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl233
\cf0 One message of the movie is that even if you are, in effect, helping a former Auschwitz guard, you should still behave morally. This lesson is one that Berg\'92s law professor tries unsuccessfully to teach his student. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl233\sa230
\cf0 The second takeaway is the profound life-altering choices and behaviors that illiteracy can make on people. People, if they are illiterate, usually view their illiteracy with shame. They blame themselves for being illiterate. Having two dyslexic children ourselves we have seen this dynamic first hand. \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233\sa230
\cf0 A failure to read is taken to be a general failure in personality, intelligence or motivation. It is presented as reason for feeling personal shame. Unfortunately, the idea that non-readers are either lazy, bad, or stupid is as prevalent today as it\'92s always been. It remains as one of society\'92s most enduring and destructive stereotypes and prejudices. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl233\sa230
\cf0 It seems that the reason most people are illiterate is either because they have not had the opportunity to learn, or that their brains are not structured in a way that their learning to read is natural. Luckily, reading is a skill that most children take to like ducks to water. \
In the movie, it is not clarified why Hanna doesn\'92t read: is she from an impoverished background, or is she dyslexic? Probably, a little bit of both. \
One of the most moving points of the movie is when Hanna and Michael go on a cycling holiday into the countryside and happen upon a church or abbey in which a children\'92s choir is practicing. \
Hanna, who remember, is hiding two fundamental secrets\'97that she is former death camp guard who also happens to be illiterate\'97sits down on a pew and listens to the choral music wafting from above. The expression of astonishment on her face when she finds this performance moving is priceless. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl231\sa230
\cf0 Her look is one of disbelief that she wasn\'92t aware that such a thing existed\'97that children\'92s voices singing choral music can be an overwhelming sensory and aesthetic experience. She seems to silently ask her boy lover \'93Were you aware that such a thing existed?\'94 He seems to reply: \'93Yes, I was aware it existed and I\'92m moved that you find it moving.\'94 \
This brings us to the underlying mystery of the 20th century\'97how a country, Germany, which has made so many fundamental contributions to world culture in literature, philosophy and even choral music\'97could descend into the utter darkness of a place like Auschwitz. \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233

\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl233\sa230
\cf0 I noticed a <a href="http://www.thespec.com/news/canada/article/660440--britain-opens-door-to-more-military-power-inpersian-gulf">story</a> in today\'92s local paper about Britain wanting to increase its naval presence in the Persian Gulf. I immediately thought that the Persian Gulf was quite a long way from the mist-shrouded shores of Great Britain. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl231\sa230
\cf0 This story also reminded me instantly of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suez_Crisis">Suez Crisis</a> of 1956. This is when Britain, France and Israel fought back against the nationalization of the Suez Canal by a newly nationalistic Egyptian government under Nasser. The USA at that time told them to back off and reminded them that responses common during a colonial era were no longer appropriate, and that new geo-political patterns had emerged. The former colonial powers were also told that they would have far fewer opportunities to throw their weight around and that the new superpower in town (then, the USA) would be calling the shots. \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233\sa230
\cf0 I predict that the same thing will happen in the Persian Gulf with the West\'92s confrontation with Iran. However, in this case it seems like the most of the West will fall into the role that Britain and France played at the time of the Suez Crisis. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl231\sa230
\cf0 If the current Iran confrontation becomes a live war\'97and it increasingly looks like it will\'97then countries of the West will be told in no uncertain terms that the rules of the game have changed, in a similar way to 1956, and that they should back off. \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233
\cf0 I predict that China and other BRIC nations will be the ones doing the telling this time.]]></content:encoded> \

\cf0 This weekend, the boys and I visited <a href="http://stpaulshamilton.ca/" target="_blank">St Paul\'92s Presbyterian Church</a> in downtown Hamilton in a <a href="http://www.doorsopenhamilton.ca/" target="_blank">Doors Open 2012</a> event. This church has a splendid Casavant Fr\'e8res organ, which the organist was playing when we arrived. St. Paul\'92s is a beautiful Victorian church, built in 1857, that has wonderful stained glass windows and wood carvings. Like most other churches of its type, it appears to suffer from a declining congregation despite its outstanding architectural attractions. \
What we thought was especially entertaining in this visit was that they allowed Doors Open visitors to sound the bells of St. Paul\'92s bell tower using their mechanical controller levers, which are located in a console up in the bell tower. These levers were marked with musical note names and numbers. A carillonneur could consult a musical score that showed these notes and numbers. It wasn\'92t that difficult to get the hang of the system after a few minutes. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl231\sa230
\cf0 This we thought was a unusually good opportunity for people to play with the bells of an historic church. In fact, I can\'92t think of another time that I have ever encountered such a thing. \
This opportunity the boys took up with gusto and were soon hammering the levers as enthusiastically as they could and attempted to play \'91Mary had a Little Lamb\'92 with eventual success. A church warden looked on sympathetically and tolerantly as two 12 year old boys tried their hardest to create acoustic mayhem using the church bells. The boys were impressed that the outside city could hear the sounds they produced. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl231
\cf0 We all thought that this <a href="../2009/10/door-open-smithville/" target="_blank">Doors Open visit</a> was reminiscent of another visit to to another Presbyterian church in the little town of Smithville, where the church tour guides were kind enough to allow the boys to operate their historic hand-pumped organ. This also greatly excited the boys in a similar way.]]></content:encoded> \

\cf0 <content:encoded><![CDATA[Is anyone out there interested in the idea of a virtual choir for the Centre for Social Innovation, Toronto (CSI)? The idea is for many singers to sing some vocal piece on their own at their own computers and then combine their contributions together later using music editing software, such as Ableton Live or Pro Tools. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl233\sa230
\cf0 The most famous example of this is the work of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7o7BrlbaDshttp://" target="_blank">Eric Whitacre</a>, which can sometimes seem a little over-produced. Whitacre combines the music with videos of people singing their parts. We could do that, or we could just do the audio portion of it. \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233\sa230
\cf0 I think the CSI idea (whatever that might be) could be promoted using music, specifically modern, secular, choral music that communicates \'91CSI\'92 in an emotionally moving way. \
What I was thinking for CSI is the rock-bottom budget version of Whitacre's idea. Sing something really simple, which even non-vocalists might be able to sing. The piece could be scored using<a href="http://www.sibelius.com/home/index_flash.html"> Sibelius</a> software. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl231\sa230
\cf0 Maybe people could hear their parts using headphones and then record their voices without re-recording the reference track. Another alternative is to record all tracks on my computer using my Apogee One microphone, one at a time. We could set up a little DIY sound booth somewhere. People could hear the music on headphones and sing it at the same time. They could see the music scroll by in the Sibelius score. \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233\sa230
\cf0 Even if you can\'92t read music if should be possible to contribute. In my experience, some really good vocalists don\'92t know how to read music. My own sight-reading skills are quite mediocre, and my pitch is far from perfect, but that doesn\'92t mean I can\'92t stumble through a score and not completely embarrass myself. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl231\sa230
\cf0 Some might ask, why not just have everyone sing at the same time like a regular choir? I think that would be much more difficult because it requires someone to be able to direct a whole gaggle of people singing. Being a vocal conductor is a difficult task that requires quite a bit of musical knowledge to do well. Plus, everyone has to be at the same place at the same time. \
If the Virtual Choir CSI idea sounds like something that interests you, then fill out this <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/ambitiouscity.com/spreadsheet/viewform? formkey=dE9CWlF0d0JWdU5EeGh6VlJZa2tmWVE6MQ#gid=0">FORM</a> and we could get together and discuss it at CSI (maybe at CSI-Annex, where I work). \

\cf0 <content:encoded><![CDATA[Last Saturday I attended a screening of <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0276819/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1">Berlin Babylon</a> (2001) at Toronto\'92s <a href="http://www.goethe.de/ins/ca/tor/enindex.htm?wt_sc=toronto">Goethe Institut</a>. My intentions in attending this event were to see a film about Berlin (a city I think about a lot), to practice my very rusty German, and to see the inside of the Goethe Institut. It was successful on all these points. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl231\sa230
\cf0 I expected a punkish or boundary-exploring film\'97especially considering it has a soundtrack by the German industrial band Einst\'fcrzende Neubauten (Collapsing New Buildings); something along the lines of the excellent <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0457247/">Legendary Sin Cities: Berlin</a> (2005). \
I thought the film would reflect aspects of one of the more counter-cultural cities in the world. Unfortunately, I was disappointed. \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233\sa230
\cf0 My negative reaction to the film surprised me greatly. After the screening I talked to a Canadian woman who also didn\'92t like the film. We both seemed to love Berlin, but didn\'92t like this portrayal of it. It didn\'92t seem to reflect the Berlin that we knew. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl233\sa230
\cf0 Implicit in the title Berlin Babylon, for me, is the idea of a place where new forms of awareness or expression are created: one in which perhaps social or sexual taboos are relaxed compared to most other places. I expected some allusion to the Weimar days when things were wild, free and disturbingly unsustainable. But there was none of that. \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl233\sa230
\cf0 Instead I found a long and occasionally boring film featuring well-known German and international architects making banal observations about the fair city of Berlin. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl233\sa230
\cf0 The film didn\'92t appear to have an organizing principle or idea. It seemed to focus on the challenges of building taller than normal buildings in the vicinity of Potsdamer Platz or Alexanderplatz, for architects, municipal officials and building owners. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl231\sa230
\cf0 There was little mention of the history of Berlin. Berlin, of course, has a very interesting history. It was an Imperial City, a metropolitan latecomer to the Industrial Revolution and the centre of Nazi oppression. It was bombed during the war, divided, and then re-joined. Now it is one of the great magnet cities of Europe and the world; one in which diverse cultures mingle and create new forms of expression. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl233\sa230
\cf0 Berlin has such a rich and interesting history, in so many ways including architectural. Making a boring film about Berlin would be a challenge I thought. \
Berlin Babylon is the opposite of a counter-cultural statement. It is an exercise in listening to well-established and privileged elites. The ideas emanating from such people are not insignificant or necessarily ill-informed of course, it is just that one might expect opposing viewpoints from other sources. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl233
\cf0 What also struck me about the film is how dated it seemed. It was a like a time capsule from a faraway time: the nineties. One before 9/11, before global financial collapse, before doubts in the practicalities of Euro integration, or perhaps doubts about the stability or sensibilities that elites\'97European elites in this case\'97bring to the table.]]></content:encoded> \
